abstract = {Since the area was first described by Fritsch and Hitzig,1 the function of the electrostimulable cortex of the cerebrum has been the subject of almost continuous controversy. The experiments were immediately called in question through criticisms of the technic by Dupuy,2 Sanderson,3 Carville and Duret,4 and others, or by abstruse metaphysical deductions such as were advanced by Hermann5 who objected to the motor area as violating the "unity of mind." The work of Ferrier,6 Carville and Duret and Hitzig soon established the fact of the electrical excitability of limited areas of the cortex, but immedi- ately a new question arose. Fritsch and Hitzig had considered the excitable zone as motor, if we may translate the expression, "entry of single psychic functions into material" by such a term. In this they were followed by Carville and Duret, who described the motor dis- turbances following lesions in the area as "paralysie de la motricit\l=e'\ volontaire corticale." Ferrier also considered the area as motor. But most of the early work had been done with dogs, and the sensory- disturbances which appear in this animal after ablation of the stim- ulable area were emphasized by Schiff,7 Nothnagel,8 Munk Â° and Hitzig,10 who interpreted the disorders of movement variously as due to the loss of muscular and cutaneous sensitivity or to the loss of kinesthetic images of the movements to be performed.},

abstract = {Behavioural flexibility in decorticate rats was examined by testing response transfer in an obstructed alleyway. In the first experiment, rats were trained to push a ball out of a cylindrical alleyway in order to gain access to the goal box. When this 'push' habit was prevented by blocking forward movement of the ball, decorticate rats were much quicker than sham-operated rats in successfully developing the novel clearance response of pulling the ball into the start box. Both groups were subsequently able to reverse effectively between responses. In a second experiment, sham-operated and decorticate rats were first shaped to pull the ball clear from the alleyway, and then required to adopt a push-type clearance response when movement of the ball towards the start box was prevented. Here, the decorticates showed difficulty both in learning to pull the ball out of the alley and in transferring to a push-type clearance response, but having transferred they coped well with subsequent reversals. This asymmetrical pattern of transfer results is not readily attributed to response preference and raises the possibility that, in some situations at least, decorticated animals may show greater behavioural flexibility than had previously been supposed.},

The present study examined digit use in control rats and rats with MtCx lesions using high-speed (1000 f/s) video recording. Temporal and spatial characteristics of individual digits were evaluated by digitizing the tip of the digits and digital joints using the motion measurement system Peak Motus. Control rats displayed differential digital use during grasping actions and MtCx damage reduced individual digit movement, both as the paw was pre-shaped for grasping and in the grasping action itself. The findings show that although grasping is retained following MtCx damage, MtCx is essential for dexterous movement. The results are discussed in relation to the idea that rodent MtCx is not only necessary for rotatory movements of the limb, but also for digital control and in relation to the similarities of rodent digit use to that described for primates.},

The corticospinal connexions in addition provide the capacity for further fractionation of movements as exemplified by individual finger movements.},

@article{Drew1996,
abstract = {One important aspect of locomotor control is the ability of an animal to make anticipatory gait modifications to avoid obstacles, by stepping either around them or over them. This paper reviews some of the evidence that suggests that the motor cortex is one of the principal structures involved in the control of such anticipatory gait modifications in cats, in particular when they are triggered by a visual signal. Evidence for this statement is provided both from experiments in which the motor cortex has been lesioned or inactivated and from studies in which the activity of motor cortical neurones has been recorded during locomotor tasks in which visual information is required to ensure the correct positioning of the paw or an appropriate modification of the limb trajectory. Inactivation of small regions of the motor cortex with the GABA agonist muscimol results in changes in the limb trajectory so that cats hit an obstacle instead of stepping over it as they do normally. A similar disruption of the hindlimb trajectory is seen following lesions of the spinal cord at T13 that interrupt the corticospinal tract. The results from cell recording studies are complementary in that they show that the activity of many identified pyramidal tract neurones increases when the cat is required to modify the forelimb or hindlimb trajectory to step over obstacles. We suggest that the major function of this increased discharge frequency is to regulate the amplitude, duration, and temporal pattern of muscle activity during the gait modification to ensure an appropriate modification of limb trajectory. We further suggest that different groups of pyramidal tract neurones are involved in regulating the activity of groups of synergistic muscles active at different times in the gait modification. For example, some groups of pyramidal tract neurones would be involved in ensuring the appropriate and sequential activation of the muscle groups involved in the initial flexion of the elbow, while others would be active prior to the repositioning of the paw on the support surface. We discuss the possibility that the motor cortical activity seen during locomotion is the sum result of a feedforward signal, which provides visuospatial information about the environment, and feedback activity, which signals, in part, the state of the interneuronal pattern generating networks in the spinal cord. The way in which the resulting descending command may interact with the basic locomotor rhythm to produce the gait modifications is discussed.},

abstract = {Although the corticospinal tract is not essential for the production of the basic locomotor rhythm in cats, it does contribute to the regulation of locomotion, particularly in situations in which there is a requirement for precise control over paw placement or limb trajectory. Lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi at the low thoracic level (T(13)) that completely interrupted both the cortico- and rubrospinal pathways produced long-term deficits in locomotion on a level surface. These deficits included a paw-drag that was probably caused both by a loss of cortico- and rubrospinal input to motoneurones controlling distal muscles as well as by a change in the relative timing of muscles acting around the hip and knee. Smaller lesions produced similar deficits from which the cats recovered relatively quickly. Cats with the largest lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi were unable to modify their gait sufficiently to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt even 3-5 months postlesion. These results imply that the medial pathways, the reticulo- and vestibulospinal pathways, are unable to fully compensate for damage to the lateral pathways. Single unit recordings from identified pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) within the hindlimb representation of the primary motor cortex (area 4) showed that a substantial proportion of neurones (67%) significantly increased their discharge frequency when the cats modified their gait to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt. Of those PTNs that showed increased activity during the swing phase, populations of neurones were activated at different times. A large proportion of PTNS discharged early in swing, in phase with knee flexors such as the semitendinosus. Others discharged slightly later, in phase with the activity of ankle flexors, such as tibialis anterior, while still others discharged at the end of swing, in phase with digit dorsiflexors, such as the extensor digitorum brevis. We suggest that different populations of cortical neurones may specifically modify the activity of selected groups of close synergistic muscles during different parts of the swing phase. We further suggest that these modifications are mediated, in part, by groups of interneurones that are involved in determining the base locomotor rhythm. This provides a means by which the changes specified by the descending signal from the motor cortex may be smoothly, and appropriately, incorporated into the locomotor cycle.},
annote = {Lesions to both the corticospinal and rubrospinal pathways in cats cause long-lasting impairments when stepping over obstacles. Partial lesions recover quickly over one to two weeks.

Interestingly, it is not an absolute inability to lift the paw, as they will adapt stepping to higher obstacles. They still fail to successfully step over, but this partial step would be enough to clear the lower obstacle.

In humans, corticospinal is more pronounced, but rubrospinal is partially degenerated. Rubrospinal in primates may be compensating for lesions (hence difference between humans and primates).},

abstract = {The ladder rung walking test is a new task to assess skilled walking and measure both forelimb and hindlimb placing, stepping, and inter-limb co-ordination. Rats spontaneously walk from a starting location to a goal along a horizontal ladder. The spacing between the rungs of the ladder is variable and can be changed to prevent the animal from learning either the absolute or relative location of the rungs. The testing procedure requires minimal training and allows detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis using video recording. The utility of the test is described with postoperative data obtained from animals with unilateral neocortical strokes produced by pial stripping over the motor cortex, neonatal and adult unilateral corticospinal tract lesions produced by tract section at the pyramids, and unilateral dopamine depletions produced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the nigrostriatal bundle. In addition, a group of aged rats was examined. Deficits in limb placing, stepping and co-ordination displayed by the animals demonstrate that this test can discriminate between lesions of the motor system or age-associated impairments. The test is useful for assessing loss and recovery of function due to brain or spinal cord injury, the effectiveness of treatment therapies, as well as compensatory processes through which animals adapt to nervous system injury.},

@article{Yang2003,
abstract = {We investigated whether direct, cortico-motoneuronal connections are present in the rat, using both light microscopic and electron microscopic techniques. Corticospinal fibres were labelled using the anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran-amine (BDA), which was injected into forelimb sensorimotor cortex. Motoneurons were retrogradely labelled after injection of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into forelimb muscles, contralateral to the injected hemisphere. Terminals of peripheral afferent fibres, which were also labelled by CTB, were easily distinguishable from, and much larger than, BDA-labelled corticospinal terminals. At the light microscope level, corticospinal terminals were found in all laminae contralateral to the injection site, most extensively in laminae VI and VII of cervical segments C5-C8. Although labelling in the ventral horn (lamina IX) was present, it was extremely sparse. A total of 47 corticospinal synapses were studied at the electron microscope level; most of these were in lamina VII and the majority (35/47; 74%) made axo-dendritic contacts with asymmetrical synapses; one made an axo-somatic synapse, and in the remaining 11 cases no postsynaptic structure could be identified. All corticospinal terminals contained spherical boutons. Serial sectioning of eight BDA-labelled corticospinal boutons in lamina IX revealed that most (seven out of eight) did not make synaptic contacts with any neuronal structure, and none made any contact with adjacent dendrites of CTB-labelled motoneurons. Thus these results provide no positive ultrastructural evidence for direct cortico-motoneuronal synaptic connections within lamina IX between corticospinal axon boutons and the proximal dendrites of forelimb motoneurons. The results confirm other lines of evidence suggesting that such connections are not present in the rat.},

@article{Donoghue1982,
abstract = {The first motor (MI) cortex of the rat was identified as the region from which movements could be evoked by the lowest intensity of electrical stimulation. The location of this region was correlated with cytoarchitecture in the frontal and parietal cortex. Two frontal areas can be discerned in Nissl-stained sections: (1) the medial agranular field, marked by a pale-staining layer III and a compact layer II, and (2) the lateral agranular field, which has more homogeneous superficial layers and a broad layer V containing large, densely staining cells. Both of these regions project to the spinal cord and can therefore be included in the somatic sensorimotor cortex. MI in the rat coincides with the lateral agranular field but also overlaps with part of the adjacent granular cortex of the first somatic sensory (SI) representation. We conclude that the rat MI cortex can be identified by microstimulation techniques and by cytoarchitecture in the rat.},

@article{Aflalo2006,
abstract = {We propose that some of the features of the topographic organization in motor cortex emerge from a competition among several conflicting mapping requisites. These competing requisites include a somatotopic map of the body, a map of hand location in space, and a partitioning of cortex into regions that emphasize different complex, ethologically relevant movements. No one type of map fully explains the topography; instead, all three influences (and perhaps others untested here) interact to form the topography. A standard algorithm (Kohonen network) was used to generate an artificial motor cortex array that optimized local continuity for these conflicting mapping requisites. The resultant hybrid map contained many features seen in actual motor cortex, including the following: a rough, overlapping somatotopy; a posterior strip in which simpler movements were represented and more somatotopic segregation was observed, and an anterior strip in which more complex, multisegmental movements were represented and the somatotopy was less segregated; a clustering of different complex, multisegmental movements into specific subregions of cortex that resembled the arrangement of subregions found in the monkey; three hand representations arranged on the cortex in a manner similar to the primary motor, dorsal premotor, and ventral premotor hand areas in the monkey; and maps of hand location that approximately matched the maps observed in the monkey.},

@article{Todorov2000,
abstract = {What neural activity in motor cortex represents and how it controls ongoing movement remain unclear. Suggestions that cortex generates low-level muscle control are discredited by correlations with higher-level parameters of hand movement, but no coherent alternative exists. I argue that the view of low-level control is in principle correct, and that seeming contradictions result from overlooking known properties of the motor periphery. Assuming direct motor cortical activation of muscle groups and taking into account the state dependence of muscle-force production and multijoint mechanics, I show that cortical population output must correlate with hand kinematics in quantitative agreement with experimental observations. The model reinterprets the 'neural population vector' to afford unified control of posture, movement and force production.},
