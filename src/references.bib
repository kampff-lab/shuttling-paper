abstract = {We propose that some of the features of the topographic organization in motor cortex emerge from a competition among several conflicting mapping requisites. These competing requisites include a somatotopic map of the body, a map of hand location in space, and a partitioning of cortex into regions that emphasize different complex, ethologically relevant movements. No one type of map fully explains the topography; instead, all three influences (and perhaps others untested here) interact to form the topography. A standard algorithm (Kohonen network) was used to generate an artificial motor cortex array that optimized local continuity for these conflicting mapping requisites. The resultant hybrid map contained many features seen in actual motor cortex, including the following: a rough, overlapping somatotopy; a posterior strip in which simpler movements were represented and more somatotopic segregation was observed, and an anterior strip in which more complex, multisegmental movements were represented and the somatotopy was less segregated; a clustering of different complex, multisegmental movements into specific subregions of cortex that resembled the arrangement of subregions found in the monkey; three hand representations arranged on the cortex in a manner similar to the primary motor, dorsal premotor, and ventral premotor hand areas in the monkey; and maps of hand location that approximately matched the maps observed in the monkey.},

abstract = {Over 30 years ago, Castro [(1972) Brain Res., 37, 173-185] proposed that motor cortex (MtCx) ablation produced deficits in digital usage that contributed to the rat's impairments in a reach-to-eat task, but the impairment was not directly documented. The present study examined digit use in control rats and rats with MtCx lesions using high-speed (1000 f/s) video recording. Temporal and spatial characteristics of individual digits were evaluated by digitizing the tip of the digits and digital joints using the motion measurement system Peak Motus. Control rats displayed differential digital use during grasping actions and MtCx damage reduced individual digit movement, both as the paw was pre-shaped for grasping and in the grasping action itself. The findings show that although grasping is retained following MtCx damage, MtCx is essential for dexterous movement. The results are discussed in relation to the idea that rodent MtCx is not only necessary for rotatory movements of the limb, but also for digital control and in relation to the similarities of rodent digit use to that described for primates.},

abstract = {The vestibular nuclei integrate information from vestibular and proprioceptive afferents, which presumably facilitates the maintenance of stable balance and posture. However, little is currently known about the processing of sensory signals from the limbs by vestibular nucleus neurons. This study tested the hypothesis that limb movement is encoded by vestibular nucleus neurons and described the changes in activity of these neurons elicited by limb extension and flexion. In decerebrate cats, we recorded the activity of 70 vestibular nucleus neurons whose activity was modulated by limb movements. Most of these neurons (57/70, 81.4{\%}) encoded information about the direction of hindlimb movement, while the remaining neurons (13/70, 18.6{\%}) encoded the presence of hindlimb movement without signaling the direction of movement. The activity of many vestibular nucleus neurons that responded to limb movement was also modulated by rotating the animal's body in vertical planes, suggesting that the neurons integrated hindlimb and labyrinthine inputs. Neurons whose firing rate increased during ipsilateral ear-down roll rotations tended to be excited by hindlimb flexion, whereas neurons whose firing rate increased during contralateral ear-down tilts were excited by hindlimb extension. These observations suggest that there is a purposeful mapping of hindlimb inputs onto vestibular nucleus neurons, such that integration of hindlimb and labyrinthine inputs to the neurons is functionally relevant.},

abstract = {1. The activation of climbing fibres projecting to the posterior lobe cerebellar cortex by focal stimulation of the cerebral corticofugal pathway was investigated in anaesthetised rats. Large climbing fibre responses were evoked in parts of crus II and paramedian lobule by stimulation of corticofugal fibres. Lesions of the pyramidal tract just rostral to the inferior olive substantially reduced these responses, suggesting that they were not mediated by relays in the rostral brainstem. 2. By comparison of latencies of climbing fibre responses evoked from different locations in the corticofugal pathway, the conduction velocities of the corticofugal fibres that mediate the responses were estimated to be 1.9 +/- 0.3 m s(-1) (mean +/- S.E.M.). The fastest conducting corticofugal fibres were estimated to conduct significantly faster (18.7 +/- 2.3 m s(-1)). 3. Climbing fibre responses with similar form and cerebellar distribution were evoked from sites in the pyramidal tract rostral and caudal to the inferior olive. This suggests that at least a proportion of the fibres that activate climbing fibres are corticospinal fibres. 4. Lesions of the dorsal column nuclei did not affect the climbing fibre responses evoked in crus II, and produced a relatively small reduction of the responses in the paramedian lobule. This implies that the climbing fibre responses were not exclusively mediated via the dorsal column nuclei. 5. Corticofugal evoked climbing fibre responses were mapped across the cerebellar hemisphere. At some sites they were co-localised with responses evoked by limb afferents. On the basis of limb afferent inputs and other work, these zones were tentatively identified as being functionally equivalent to the c1, c2 and d zones described in the cat.},

abstract = {The corticospinal tract (CST) of the rat is a widely used model system in developmental, physiological, and regeneration studies. The CST of the rat consists of a main tract, that runs in the dorsomedial funiculus and several minor components. We have shown earlier that one of the minor components, the ipsilateral, ventral CST, projects all the way down the spinal cord in the adult rat and single fibers form large terminal arbors in their spinal target areas. Here we investigated its ultrastructure and compared it to that of CST fibers of the main tract. By the use of anterograde axonal tracing with biotin dextran-amine (BDA) and pre-embedding avidin-peroxidase histochemistry we investigated axon diameters and myelination using electron microscopy. Ipsilateral, ventral CST fibers were found to run in the ventral funiculus close to the midline. They were intermingled with heavily myelinated large diameter axons, presumably reticulospinal, vestibulospinal, or tectospinal fibers. Ipsilateral, ventral CST fibers were of small diameter (0.68 microm, +/-0.04) and about [frac34] of them were moderately myelinated (9.64 +/- 0.7 layers of myelin). Co-localization of a rhodamine-dextrane anterograde tracer with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin using confocal microscopy and electron microscopy revealed varicosities on terminal arborisations to be presynaptic boutons and clearly demonstrated contacts to neurons in intermediate laminae of the spinal cord at lumbar spinal levels. This study extends our earlier work indicating that the ipsilateral, ventral CST component of the adult rat is a morphologically complete CST component and may perform similar functions to the main CST component.},

Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

abstract = {1. In normal subjects, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand region of the motor cortex evokes motor responses only in contralateral hand muscles at a latency of about 19-24 ms. In contrast, stimulation of the motor cortex of three mirror movement subjects evoked, nearly simultaneously, motor responses in hand muscles on both sides of the body at latencies similar to those of normal subjects. In these subjects no other neuroanatomical pathways appear to be abnormally directed across the mid-line. Thus, their mirror movements are probably due to a projection of the corticospinal tract to homologous motoneurone pools on each side of the body. 2. We reasoned that if the motor cortex contributes to the generation of long-latency stretch reflex responses then in these mirror movement subjects stretching a muscle on one side of the body should produce long-latency reflex responses in the ipsilateral and the homologous contralateral muscle. 3. To test this idea experiments were done on normal human subjects and on the subjects with mirror movements. The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the flexor pollicis longus muscle (FPL) on each side of the body was recorded. Stretch of the distal phalanx of the thumb of one hand produced a series of distinct reflex EMG responses in the ipsilateral FPL. The earliest response, when present, began at 25 ms (S.D. = 3.5 ms) and was followed by responses at 40 (S.D. = 3.9 ms) and 56 ms (S.D. = 4.3 ms). There was no difference, either in timing or intensity, between the ipsilateral FPL EMG responses of normal subjects and those of the mirror movement subjects. 4. No response of any kind was observed in the contralateral (unstretched) FPL of normal subjects. In contrast, we observed in all three mirror movement subjects EMG responses in the contralateral (unstretched) FPL beginning at 45-50 ms. The latency of this response is considerably shorter than the fastest voluntary kinaesthetic reaction time, which was on average 130 ms (S.D. = 11 ms). The contralateral long-latency EMG response observed in the mirror movement subjects was on average 30{\%} (range 5-60{\%}) of that on the ipsilateral side. No short-latency response (25 ms) was ever observed in the contralateral FPL of these subjects. 5. These observations are quite consistent with the idea that the long-latency stretch reflex responses of hand and finger muscles are produced, at least in part, by the motor cortex.},

abstract = {The relationship between neural activity in motor cortex and movement is highly debated. Although many studies have examined the spatial tuning (e.g., for direction) of cortical responses, less attention has been paid to the temporal properties of individual neuron responses. We developed a novel task, employing two instructed speeds, that allows meaningful averaging of neural responses across reaches with nearly identical velocity profiles. Doing so preserves fine temporal structure and reveals considerable complexity and heterogeneity of response patterns in primary motor and premotor cortex. Tuning for direction was prominent, but the preferred direction was frequently inconstant with respect to time, instructed-speed, and/or reach distance. Response patterns were often temporally complex and multiphasic, and varied with direction and instructed speed in idiosyncratic ways. A wide variety of patterns was observed, and it was not uncommon for a neuron to exhibit a pattern shared by no other neuron in our dataset. Response patterns of individual neurons rarely, if ever, matched those of individual muscles. Indeed, the set of recorded responses spanned a much higher dimensional space than would be expected for a model in which neural responses relate to a moderate number of factors-dynamic, kinematic, or otherwise. Complex responses may provide a basis-set representing many parameters. Alternately, it may be necessary to discard the notion that responses exist to "represent" movement parameters. It has been argued that complex and heterogeneous responses are expected of a recurrent network that produces temporally patterned outputs, and the present results would seem to support this view.},

abstract = {Most theories of motor cortex have assumed that neural activity represents movement parameters. This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.},

Each test was designed to assess a sepa- rate and particular ability or defect. The first test, a matchbox drawer and weights, gave us some measure of the motor power in the thumb when the monkey opposed the thumb and index finger. We next wished to assess a monkey's ability to discriminate, by palpa- tion, between three-dimensional solids, so keeping in mind the work of Ruch, Fulton, and German (3) on chimpanzees, we evolved our second test with our cone, pyramid, and wedge. Finally, because we observed that even when motor and sensory abilities have shown recovery, there appears to remain some considerable loss of dexterity in the use of the fingers and thumb, we have designed our dexterity board, which affords some measure of this defect.},

abstract = {Muscimol has been used to increase our knowledge of central GABAergic systems, CNS physiology, and behavior. Some studies concerning the neurophysiological and behavioral effects of muscimol and its analogs have been reviewed and analyzed. In vivo iontophoretic studies have greatly increased our knowledge of the active conformation(s) adopted by GABA during its interaction with neuronal synaptic (or extrasynaptic) receptors, and behavioral studies have supported the notion that central GABAergic systems might be involved in convulsions, extrapyramidal functions, and other behaviors. However, behavioral studies with muscimol remain difficult to interpret in terms of central GABAergic systems, especially since muscimol is extensively metabolized and since it appears to interact with membrane sites other than GABA receptors. Muscimol does not appear to be useful for reversing human neurologic-psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Background: We have developed a setup for rats that allows for controlled sensory input to an animal engaged in a task while recording both electrophysiological signals and behavioral output. New method: We record electrophysiological signals using a novel high-density micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) grid that covers almost the whole somatosensory system. We dealt with the well-known difficulty that the rat uses its whisker system in an active (motor-controlled) way to explore its environment by designing a head-mounted device that stimulates the rat's snout in a way unaffected by whisker movements. Results: We replicate the spatial specificity of early evoked responses in somatosensory and auditory cortex. In a companion paper (Cognitive Neurophysiology in Rats, Part 2: Validation and Demonstration) we validate our setup and show for the first time that the ECoG can be used to record evoked responses in a signal that reflects neural output (spiking activity). Comparison with existing methods: Compared with high-density wire recordings, micro-ECoG offers a much more stable signal without readjustments, and a much better scalability. Compared with head-fixed preparations, our head-mounted stimulator allows to stay closer to the rat's natural way of collecting sensory information. Conclusions: For perceptual and cognitive research, our setup provides a unique combination of possibilities that cannot be achieved in other setups for rodents. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The first motor (MI) cortex of the rat was identified as the region from which movements could be evoked by the lowest intensity of electrical stimulation. The location of this region was correlated with cytoarchitecture in the frontal and parietal cortex. Two frontal areas can be discerned in Nissl-stained sections: (1) the medial agranular field, marked by a pale-staining layer III and a compact layer II, and (2) the lateral agranular field, which has more homogeneous superficial layers and a broad layer V containing large, densely staining cells. Both of these regions project to the spinal cord and can therefore be included in the somatic sensorimotor cortex. MI in the rat coincides with the lateral agranular field but also overlaps with part of the adjacent granular cortex of the first somatic sensory (SI) representation. We conclude that the rat MI cortex can be identified by microstimulation techniques and by cytoarchitecture in the rat.},

abstract = {The classical notion that the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are dedicated to motor control is under dispute given increasing evidence of their involvement in non-motor functions. Is it then impossible to characterize the functions of the cerebellum, the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex in a simplistic manner? This paper presents a novel view that their computational roles can be characterized not by asking what are the "goals" of their computation, such as motor or sensory, but by asking what are the "methods" of their computation, specifically, their learning algorithms. There is currently enough anatomical, physiological, and theoretical evidence to support the hypotheses that the cerebellum is a specialized organism for supervised learning, the basal ganglia are for reinforcement learning, and the cerebral cortex is for unsupervised learning.This paper investigates how the learning modules specialized for these three kinds of learning can be assembled into goal-oriented behaving systems. In general, supervised learning modules in the cerebellum can be utilized as "internal models" of the environment. Reinforcement learning modules in the basal ganglia enable action selection by an "evaluation" of environmental states. Unsupervised learning modules in the cerebral cortex can provide statistically efficient representation of the states of the environment and the behaving system. Two basic action selection architectures are shown, namely, reactive action selection and predictive action selection. They can be implemented within the anatomical constraint of the network linking these structures. Furthermore, the use of the cerebellar supervised learning modules for state estimation, behavioral simulation, and encapsulation of learned skill is considered. Finally, the usefulness of such theoretical frameworks in interpreting brain imaging data is demonstrated in the paradigm of procedural learning.},

@article{Drew1996,
abstract = {One important aspect of locomotor control is the ability of an animal to make anticipatory gait modifications to avoid obstacles, by stepping either around them or over them. This paper reviews some of the evidence that suggests that the motor cortex is one of the principal structures involved in the control of such anticipatory gait modifications in cats, in particular when they are triggered by a visual signal. Evidence for this statement is provided both from experiments in which the motor cortex has been lesioned or inactivated and from studies in which the activity of motor cortical neurones has been recorded during locomotor tasks in which visual information is required to ensure the correct positioning of the paw or an appropriate modification of the limb trajectory. Inactivation of small regions of the motor cortex with the GABA agonist muscimol results in changes in the limb trajectory so that cats hit an obstacle instead of stepping over it as they do normally. A similar disruption of the hindlimb trajectory is seen following lesions of the spinal cord at T13 that interrupt the corticospinal tract. The results from cell recording studies are complementary in that they show that the activity of many identified pyramidal tract neurones increases when the cat is required to modify the forelimb or hindlimb trajectory to step over obstacles. We suggest that the major function of this increased discharge frequency is to regulate the amplitude, duration, and temporal pattern of muscle activity during the gait modification to ensure an appropriate modification of limb trajectory. We further suggest that different groups of pyramidal tract neurones are involved in regulating the activity of groups of synergistic muscles active at different times in the gait modification. For example, some groups of pyramidal tract neurones would be involved in ensuring the appropriate and sequential activation of the muscle groups involved in the initial flexion of the elbow, while others would be active prior to the repositioning of the paw on the support surface. We discuss the possibility that the motor cortical activity seen during locomotion is the sum result of a feedforward signal, which provides visuospatial information about the environment, and feedback activity, which signals, in part, the state of the interneuronal pattern generating networks in the spinal cord. The way in which the resulting descending command may interact with the basic locomotor rhythm to produce the gait modifications is discussed.},

abstract = {Although the corticospinal tract is not essential for the production of the basic locomotor rhythm in cats, it does contribute to the regulation of locomotion, particularly in situations in which there is a requirement for precise control over paw placement or limb trajectory. Lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi at the low thoracic level (T(13)) that completely interrupted both the cortico- and rubrospinal pathways produced long-term deficits in locomotion on a level surface. These deficits included a paw-drag that was probably caused both by a loss of cortico- and rubrospinal input to motoneurones controlling distal muscles as well as by a change in the relative timing of muscles acting around the hip and knee. Smaller lesions produced similar deficits from which the cats recovered relatively quickly. Cats with the largest lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi were unable to modify their gait sufficiently to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt even 3-5 months postlesion. These results imply that the medial pathways, the reticulo- and vestibulospinal pathways, are unable to fully compensate for damage to the lateral pathways. Single unit recordings from identified pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) within the hindlimb representation of the primary motor cortex (area 4) showed that a substantial proportion of neurones (67{\%}) significantly increased their discharge frequency when the cats modified their gait to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt. Of those PTNs that showed increased activity during the swing phase, populations of neurones were activated at different times. A large proportion of PTNS discharged early in swing, in phase with knee flexors such as the semitendinosus. Others discharged slightly later, in phase with the activity of ankle flexors, such as tibialis anterior, while still others discharged at the end of swing, in phase with digit dorsiflexors, such as the extensor digitorum brevis. We suggest that different populations of cortical neurones may specifically modify the activity of selected groups of close synergistic muscles during different parts of the swing phase. We further suggest that these modifications are mediated, in part, by groups of interneurones that are involved in determining the base locomotor rhythm. This provides a means by which the changes specified by the descending signal from the motor cortex may be smoothly, and appropriately, incorporated into the locomotor cycle.},
annote = {Lesions to both the corticospinal and rubrospinal pathways in cats cause long-lasting impairments when stepping over obstacles. Partial lesions recover quickly over one to two weeks.

Interestingly, it is not an absolute inability to lift the paw, as they will adapt stepping to higher obstacles. They still fail to successfully step over, but this partial step would be enough to clear the lower obstacle.

In humans, corticospinal is more pronounced, but rubrospinal is partially degenerated. Rubrospinal in primates may be compensating for lesions (hence difference between humans and primates).},

Unilateral inactivation of the FOF resulted in impaired contralateral responses. Extracellular recordings of single units revealed that 37{\%} of FOF neurons had delay period firing rates that predicted the direction of the rats' later orienting motion.

abstract = {THIS REPORT DESCRIBES the third in a series of studies of the relation of discharge of pyramdal tract neurons (PTNs) to voluntary movement. The first of the previous studies (5) showed that PTN activity both at rest and during movement is related to axonal conduction velocity. PTNs with the highest axonal conduction velocities tend to be silent during motor quiescence and to show phasic activity in association with movement. PTNs with lower axonal conduction velocities are for the most part active even in the absence of movement; with movement they show both upward and downward modulation of their resting discharge frequency. A second study (6) was carried out to obtain information as to the point in the interval between stimulus and response at which PTN discharge takes place in association with a conditioned hand movement. It was found that for many PTNs, responses to the conditioned stimulus (the onset of a light) preceded the first peripheral electromyographic correlates of the condi- tioned response (wrist extension). The fact that these PTN responses preceded the electromyographic response showed that they were not consequent upon feedback resulting from the movement. The present study was intended to answer a third question concerning the way in which PTN activity is related to movement: Is the discharge of PTNs related to the force exerted by the moving part, or does PTN activity more nearly parallel the displacement which results from this force?},

abstract = {From studies of subhuman primates it has been assumed that functional corticospinal innervation occurs post-natally in man. We report a post-mortem morphological study of human spinal cord, and neurophysiological and behavioural studies in preterm and term neonates and infants. From morphological studies it was demonstrated that corticospinal axons reach the lower cervical spinal cord by 24 weeks post-conceptional age (PCA) at the latest. Following a waiting period of up to a few weeks, it appears they progressively innervate the grey matter such that there is extensive innervation of spinal neurons, including motor neurons, prior to birth. Functional monosynaptic corticomotoneuronal projections were demonstrated neurophysiologically from term, but are also likely to be present from as early as 26 weeks PCA. At term, direct corticospinal projections to Group Ia inhibitory interneurons were also confirmed. Independent finger movements developed much later, between 6 and 12 months post-natally. These data do not support the proposal that in man, establishment of functional corticomotoneuronal projections occurs immediately prior to and provides the capacity for the expression of fine finger movement control. We propose instead that such early corticospinal innervation occurs to permit cortical involvement in activity dependent maturation of spinal motor centres during a critical period of perinatal development. Spastic cerebral palsy from perinatal damage to the corticospinal pathway secondarily involves disrupted development of spinal motor centres. Corticospinal axons retain a high degree of plasticity during axon growth and synaptic development. The possibility therefore exists to promote regeneration of disrupted corticospinal projections during the perinatal period with the double benefit of restoring corticospinal connectivity and normal development of spinal motor centres.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Skilled reaching movements are an important aspect of human motor behavior but are impaired after motor system stroke. The purpose of this study was to document skilled movements in mice before and after a focal motor cortex stroke for the purpose of developing a mouse model of human stroke. METHODS: Male C57/BL6 mice were trained to reach with a forelimb for food pellets and then given a motor cortex stroke, induced by pial stripping, contralateral to their preferred reaching limb. Reaching success and the movements used in reaching were analyzed by frame-by-frame inspection of presurgical and postsurgical video records. RESULTS: Reaching success was severely impaired after the stroke. Improvement in success over 2 postsurgical weeks was moderate. Analysis of 10 movement components comprising reaches pre- and postsurgically indicated that most of the rotatory movements of the limb used for aiming, advancing, pronating, and supinating the paw were impaired. When successful reaches did occur, body movements that compensated for the impairments in limb rotatory movements aided them. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that skilled reaching in the mouse is impaired by focal motor cortex stroke and they suggest that the mouse, and the skilled reaching task, provides an excellent model for studying impairments, compensation, and recovery after motor system stroke.},

This was a crucial event in the development of modern neuroscience because it was the first good experimental evidence for a) cerebral cortex involvement in motor function, b) the electrical excitability of the cortex, c) topographic representation in the brain, and d) localization of function in different regions of the cerebral cortex. This paper discusses their experiment and some developments in the previous two centuries that led to it including the ideas of Thomas Willis and Emanuel Swedenborg, the widespread interest in electricity and the localizations of function of Franz Joseph Gall, John Hughlings Jackson, and Paul Broca.

Here we used rapid, reversible optogenetic inhibition to test the role of cortex during a head-fixed task in which mice reach, grab, and eat a food pellet. Sudden cortical inhibition blocked initiation or froze execution of this skilled prehension behavior, but left untrained forelimb movements unaffected. Unexpectedly, kinematically normal prehension occurred immediately after cortical inhibition even during rest periods lacking cue and pellet. This 'rebound' prehension was only evoked in trained and food-deprived animals, suggesting that a motivation-gated motor engram sufficient to evoke prehension is activated at inhibition's end. These results demonstrate the necessity and sufficiency of cortical activity for enacting a learned skill.},

abstract = {Exploratory whisking in rat is an example of self-generated movement on multiple timescales, from slow variations in the envelope of whisking to the rapid sequence of muscle contractions during a single whisk cycle. We find that, as a population, spike trains of single units in primary vibrissa motor cortex report the absolute angle of vibrissa position. This representation persists after sensory nerve transection, indicating an efferent source. About two-thirds of the units are modulated by slow variations in the envelope of whisking, while relatively few units report rapid changes in position within the whisk cycle. The combined results from this study and past measurements, which show that primary sensory cortex codes the whisking envelope as a motor copy signal, imply that signals present in both sensory and motor cortices are necessary to compute angular coordinates based on vibrissa touch. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the relation of motor cortical neural activity in the rat to self-paced reach-to-grasp movements. Overall, around 40{\%} of excitatory and 60{\%} of inhibitory modulations in neuronal activity began prior to reach onset. These data are consistent with a role for rat motor cortex in the initiation and control of the reaching movement. In addition, although the reach only lasted a short time, 30{\%} of excitations and inhibitions began while it was in progress. The existence of such modulations occurring during the reach is consistent with previous data showing activity of cortical neurons late in the reach, and suggests a heavy involvement of cortical neurons in controlling the recently described, complex movements associated with grasping that are seen in the rat. These features were broadly similar in neurones from both the caudal and rostral subdivisions of rat motor cortex.},

@article{Jarratt1999,
abstract = {The activity of 259 task-related red nucleus neurons was recorded using chronic electrophysiological methods in free moving rats. Modulations in activity were analysed in relation to onset (first detected wrist movement) and end (arrival of the paw over the food) of a reach-to-grasp movement. Excitatory peaks were found to begin before, during and after the reach, but there were clear peaks in the distribution of onset times after reach-onset and before reach-end, reflecting the fact that one third of all peaks began specifically during the reach, although this occupied only a small fraction of the analysis time. Both excitations and inhibitions showed a strong tendency to end in close temporal association with reach-end. Analysis of excitatory modulation amplitudes showed that the largest peaks were formed when data was aligned to reach-end, and that these largest peaks nearly all began during the reach and ended precisely at the time the paw would have been about to grasp the food. The spread of neural activation onset times throughout the course of the complex reach-to-grasp movement is consistent with a relationship of individual neurons in the rat red nucleus with movements of all parts of the forelimb, as would be expected if all limb muscle groups are represented in the nucleus. On the other hand the disproportionate number of modulations that occur during the reach and their strong alignment with time of reach-end suggests there is a bias in red nucleus function towards the control of distal motions associated with accurate grasp, consistent with the result of recent lesion studies. This provides indirect evidence that functionally the rat red nucleus may be organized in a similar way to that of monkeys, in which an important role in control of accurate distal movements is well established. The possibility is discussed that red nucleus offers a timing signal for co-ordination of movements across joints, in particular the precise distal-proximal bending normally seen in accurate reach-to-grasp movements.},

abstract = {The corticospinal projection is considered to influence fine motor function through nearly exclusively contralateral projections from the cortex in primates. However, unilateral lesions to this system in various species are frequently followed by significant functional improvement, raising the possibility that bilateral projections of this pathway may exist or emerge after injury. To examine the detailed anatomy and projections of the corticospinal motor neurons in rhesus monkeys (n = 4), we injected the high-resolution anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into 126 sites centered about the right lower extremity (LE) primary motor cortex. Projection and termination patterns were quantified at lumbar levels L1, L4, and L7 and mapped by using serial-section reconstructions. Notably, a mean of 10.1 +/- 0.6{\%} (+/- SEM) of corticospinal tract (CST) axons descended in the lateral CST ipsilateral to the cortical BDA injection, and 87.9 +/- 1.0{\%} of total CST axons projected in the contralateral lateral CST. The ipsilateral ventral CST contained only 1.0 +/- 0{\%} of all projecting CST axons, whereas the contralateral ventral CST contained 0.3 +/- 0.2{\%} of all axons. In addition, a minor dorsal column CST projection was identified. Measurement of BDA-labeled terminals in the spinal cord gray matter revealed that 11.2 +/- 2.2{\%} of CST axons terminated ipsilateral to the side of cortical injection, and the remainder terminated contralaterally. As previously reported, most CST axons terminated in spinal cord laminae V-VIII, as well as the laterodorsal motoneuronal group of lamina IX (which innervates distal extremity muscles). Notably, many CST axons crossed the spinal cord midline (mean 19.9 +/- 4.9 axons per 40-microm-thick section). Detailed single-axon reconstructions revealed that most ipsilaterally projecting lateral CST axons terminated in ipsilateral gray matter. Notably, we found that the bouton-like swellings of many ipsilateral CST axons descending in the dorsolateral tract were located within Rexed's lamina IX, in close proximity to motoneuronal somata. Thus, bilateral projections of corticospinal axons originating from a single motor cortex could contribute to bilateral control of spinal motor neurons and to the highly evolved degree of fine motor control in primates. Furthermore, bilateral CST projections from a single motor cortex could represent a potential source of plasticity after injury, as well as a target of therapeutic effort in neural regeneration strategies.},

abstract = {Since the area was first described by Fritsch and Hitzig,1 the function of the electrostimulable cortex of the cerebrum has been the subject of almost continuous controversy. The experiments were immediately called in question through criticisms of the technic by Dupuy,2 Sanderson,3 Carville and Duret,4 and others, or by abstruse metaphysical deductions such as were advanced by Hermann5 who objected to the motor area as violating the "unity of mind." The work of Ferrier,6 Carville and Duret and Hitzig soon established the fact of the electrical excitability of limited areas of the cortex, but immedi- ately a new question arose. Fritsch and Hitzig had considered the excitable zone as motor, if we may translate the expression, "entry of single psychic functions into material" by such a term. In this they were followed by Carville and Duret, who described the motor dis- turbances following lesions in the area as "paralysie de la motricit$\backslash$l=e'$\backslash$ volontaire corticale." Ferrier also considered the area as motor. But most of the early work had been done with dogs, and the sensory- disturbances which appear in this animal after ablation of the stim- ulable area were emphasized by Schiff,7 Nothnagel,8 Munk ° and Hitzig,10 who interpreted the disorders of movement variously as due to the loss of muscular and cutaneous sensitivity or to the loss of kinesthetic images of the movements to be performed.},

abstract = {Corticospinal fibres terminate in three areas in the spinal grey matter of the rhesus monkey: the nucleus proprius of the dorsal horn, the intermediate zone and directly upon motoneurons, particularly those inervating limb muscles. It was suggested at their earliest discovery that direct corticomotoneuronal (CM) connections might constitute a critical anatomical substrate for the type of fractionated movement exemplified by relatively independent finger movements (RIFM). The present study was undertaken in an attempt to provide further evidence in support of this idea. The evidence is based upon the anatomical finding that few CM connections are present at birth in the monkey, the bulk being formed postnatally to reach an adult density at approximately 8 months of age. There were two experimental approaches: in the first it was argued that if RIFM are dependent upon the presence of CM connections it would be expected that such movements would appear only gradually postnatally, developing in parallel with the development of the connections. In 2 normal monkeys studied from this point of view discrete distal movements did develop only gradually with RIFM reaching an adult level at 7 to 8 months of age. The second experimental appraoch was based upon the fact that pyramidal lesions in newborn animals interrupt corticospinal fibres before CM connections are formed. It was argued that such a situation might provide a better opportunity for other descending pathways to establish the connections necessary for RIFM. Five infant monkeys had bilateral pyramidal tract lesions made from 5 days to 4 weeks after birth and were observed for a period of three years. In the 4 animals in which the lesions were complete, RIFM failed to develop. In the fifth animal, in which the lesions were incomplete, there was development of some degree of RIFM. It was concluded that the development of RIFM is dependent upon fibres passing in the pyramidal tracts and that in infant monkeys, as well as in adults, other descending pathways are unable to form the connections necessary for these movements. The possible contribution to RIFM of the corticospinal fibres arise in the somatosensory cortex and terminate in the dorsal horn was studied by bilateral removal of the arm and leg area of the somatosensory cortex in one animal. Since RIFM were only minimally and transiently altered, it was concluded that such movements are not dependent upon these fibres. The different lines of evidence presented in the study are interpreted as giving further support to the idea that corticomotoneuronal connections constitute an essential anatomical substrate for fractionated movements such as RIFM. Observations were also made of the development of general locomotor activity in normal and pyramidotomized infant monkeys.},

In contrast, interruption of the ventromedial pathways resulted in a flexion bias of trunk and limbs and a severe impairment of axial and of proximal extremity movements.

Conclusion: The ventromedial brain-stem pathways function as the basic system by which the brain exerts control over movement. The lateral brain-stem pathways superimpose upon the above control the capacity for independent use of the extremity, particularly of the hand.

The corticospinal connexions in addition provide the capacity for further fractionation of movements as exemplified by individual finger movements.},

abstract = {A prominent feature of thalamocortical circuitry in sensory systems is the extensive and highly organized feedback projection from the cortex to the thalamic neurons that provide stimulus-specific input to the cortex. In lightly sedated rats, we found that focal enhancement of motor cortex activity facilitated sensory-evoked responses of topographically aligned neurons in primary somatosensory cortex, including antidromically identified corticothalamic cells; similar effects were observed in ventral posterior medial thalamus (VPm). In behaving rats, thalamic responses were normally smaller during whisking but larger when signal transmission in brainstem trigeminal nuclei was bypassed or altered. During voluntary movement, sensory activity may be globally suppressed in the brainstem, whereas signaling by cortically facilitated VPm neurons is simultaneously enhanced relative to other VPm neurons receiving no such facilitation.},

abstract = {The ladder rung walking test is a new task to assess skilled walking and measure both forelimb and hindlimb placing, stepping, and inter-limb co-ordination. Rats spontaneously walk from a starting location to a goal along a horizontal ladder. The spacing between the rungs of the ladder is variable and can be changed to prevent the animal from learning either the absolute or relative location of the rungs. The testing procedure requires minimal training and allows detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis using video recording. The utility of the test is described with postoperative data obtained from animals with unilateral neocortical strokes produced by pial stripping over the motor cortex, neonatal and adult unilateral corticospinal tract lesions produced by tract section at the pyramids, and unilateral dopamine depletions produced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the nigrostriatal bundle. In addition, a group of aged rats was examined. Deficits in limb placing, stepping and co-ordination displayed by the animals demonstrate that this test can discriminate between lesions of the motor system or age-associated impairments. The test is useful for assessing loss and recovery of function due to brain or spinal cord injury, the effectiveness of treatment therapies, as well as compensatory processes through which animals adapt to nervous system injury.},

abstract = {The distribution of corticospinal projection neurons in adult rats was determined using a retrograde tracing technique. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and an emulsifier (Nonidet) were injected into the 5th and 6th segments of the cervical spinal cord. The greatest concentrations of HRP-positive neurons were distributed in area 4 and rostral area 6/8 (motor cortices) and medial area 3 and caudal area 2 (somatosensory cortices). The largest labeled neurons were in areas 4 and 3. HRP-positive neurons were absent or few in regions of motor and somatosensory fields which contained the face representation. Less dense concentrations of retrogradely labeled neurons were also in posterior parietal and association areas 14, 39 and 40, rostral occipital visual areas 18a and 18b, and anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas 24a, 24b, and 32. The topography of the corticospinal pathway was determined by injecting HRP without Nonidet into the cervical, upper thoracic, lower thoracic, or lumbar spinal cord. Although the distribution of labeled neurons decreased with distance down the spinal cord, the size of the corticospinal neurons in each cytoarchitectonic area was not significantly different regardless of where the injection was placed. For example, upper thoracic cord injections retrogradely labeled neurons in each of the regions containing neurons filled by cervical cord injections, however, lumbar injections retrogradely labeled neurons only in caudal areas 4 and 3 and in area 18b. The distribution of corticospinal neurons in rats in similar to the organization of the corticospinal system in higher animals.

The basic structure is fixed for the first phase of work extending to some point in July. Everyone is invited to contribute to the discussion of the second phase. Sussman is coordinator of "Vision Project" meetings and should be consulted by anyone who wishes to participate. The primary goal of the project is to construct a system of programs which will divide a vidisector picture into regions such as likely objects, likely background areas and chaos. We shall call this part of its operation FIGURE-GROUND analysis. It will be impossible to do this without considerable analysis of shape and surface properties, so FIGURE-GROUND analysis is really inseparable in practice from the second goal which is REGION DESCRIPTION. The final goal is OBJECT IDENTIFICATION which will actually name objects by matching them with a vocabulary of known objects.},

abstract = {Cortical-feedback projections to primary sensory areas terminate most heavily in layer 1 (L1) of the neocortex, where they make synapses with tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons. L1 input is thought to provide ‘contextual' information, but the signals transmitted by L1 feedback remain uncharacterized. In the rodent somatosensory system, the spatially diffuse feedback projection from vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) to vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1, also known as the barrel cortex) may allow whisker touch to be interpreted in the context of whisker position to compute object location. When mice palpate objects with their whiskers to localize object features, whisker touch excites vS1 and later vM1 in a somatotopic manner. Here we use axonal calcium imaging to track activity in vM1--{\textgreater}vS1 afferents in L1 of the barrel cortex while mice performed whisker-dependent object localization. Spatially intermingled individual axons represent whisker movements, touch and other behavioural features. In a subpopulation of axons, activity depends on object location and persists for seconds after touch. Neurons in the barrel cortex thus have information to integrate movements and touches of multiple whiskers over time, key components of object identification and navigation by active touch.},

abstract = {The intensity and spatial distribution of functional activation in the left precentral and postcentral gyri during actual motor performance (MP) and mental representation [motor imagery (MI)] of self-paced finger-to-thumb opposition movements of the dominant hand were investigated in fourteen right-handed volunteers by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Significant increases in mean normalized fMRI signal intensities over values obtained during the control (visual imagery) tasks were found in a region including the anterior bank and crown of the central sulcus, the presumed site of the primary motor cortex, during both MP (mean percentage increase, 2.1{\%}) and MI (0.8{\%}). In the anterior portion of the precentral gyrus and the postcentral gyrus, mean functional activity levels were also increased during both conditions (MP, 1.7 and 1.2{\%}; MI, 0.6 and 0.4{\%}, respectively). To locate activated foci during MI, MP, or both conditions, the time course of the signal intensities of pixels lying in the precentral or postcentral gyrus was plotted against single-step or double-step waveforms, where the steps of the waveform corresponded to different tasks. Pixels significantly (r {\textgreater} 0.7) activated during both MP and MI were identified in each region in the majority of subjects; percentage increases in signal intensity during MI were on average 30{\%} as great as increases during MP. The pixels activated during both MP and MI appear to represent a large fraction of the whole population activated during MP. These results support the hypothesis that MI and MP involve overlapping neural networks in perirolandic cortical areas.},

abstract = {A category of stimuli of great importance for primates, humans in particular, is that formed by actions done by other individuals. If we want to survive, we must understand the actions of others. Furthermore, without action understanding, social organization is impossible. In the case of humans, there is another faculty that depends on the observation of others' actions: imitation learning. Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism—the mirror-neuron mechanism—that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the mirror-neuron system and language.},

abstract = {1. Monkeys were trained to trace sinusoids with their index fingers on a planar surface. During this task, both the direction and speed of movement varied continuously. Activity of individual units in the precentral gyrus contralateral to the moving arm was recorded as the task was performed. These cells responded to passive movement of the shoulder and/or elbow. The relation between discharge rate and movement direction for these individual cells could be described with a cosine tuning function. 2. Data recorded as the sinusoid was traced were divided into 100 bins as each cell was studied during the experiment. In each bin, the activity of a particular cell was represented by a vector. The vector ("cell vector") pointed in the direction of finger movement that corresponded to the highest rate of neuronal discharge. This direction, referred to as the preferred direction, corresponded to the peak of the cosine tuning function. The direction of the vector was constant between bins, but the magnitude of this cell's vector was a function of the instantaneous discharge rate. 3. This cell vector is a hypothetical contribution of a single cell to the population response comprised of 554 similarly derived vectors from different cells. The population response was represented as the vector that resulted from forming the sum of the vector contributions from the individual cells. A separate calculation was made for each bin, resulting in 100 population vectors for each sinusoid. 4. Within a given time series of population vectors, their lengths and directions varied in a consistent relation to the tangential velocity of the drawing movement.},

abstract = {Behavioural flexibility in decorticate rats was examined by testing response transfer in an obstructed alleyway. In the first experiment, rats were trained to push a ball out of a cylindrical alleyway in order to gain access to the goal box. When this 'push' habit was prevented by blocking forward movement of the ball, decorticate rats were much quicker than sham-operated rats in successfully developing the novel clearance response of pulling the ball into the start box. Both groups were subsequently able to reverse effectively between responses. In a second experiment, sham-operated and decorticate rats were first shaped to pull the ball clear from the alleyway, and then required to adopt a push-type clearance response when movement of the ball towards the start box was prevented. Here, the decorticates showed difficulty both in learning to pull the ball out of the alley and in transferring to a push-type clearance response, but having transferred they coped well with subsequent reversals. This asymmetrical pattern of transfer results is not readily attributed to response preference and raises the possibility that, in some situations at least, decorticated animals may show greater behavioural flexibility than had previously been supposed.},

Suggestions that cortex generates low-level muscle control are discredited by correlations with higher-level parameters of hand movement, but no coherent alternative exists. I argue that the view of low-level control is in principle correct, and that seeming contradictions result from overlooking known properties of the motor periphery. Assuming direct motor cortical activation of muscle groups and taking into account the state dependence of muscle-force production and multijoint mechanics, I show that cortical population output must correlate with hand kinematics in quantitative agreement with experimental observations. The model reinterprets the 'neural population vector' to afford unified control of posture, movement and force production.},

abstract = {Although input from corticostriatal neurons (CSNs) plays a critical role in basal ganglia functions, little is known about CSN activity during behavior. We compared the properties of antidromically identified CSNs with those of antidromically identified neurons that project via the cerebral peduncle to distant targets. Both types of neurons were recorded in primary motor cortex (M1) of two monkeys as they performed a step-tracking task in which static loads opposed or assisted simple and precued movements of the elbow or wrist. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that CSNs and corticopeduncular neurons (CPNs) belong to distinct populations. No cells were activated from both striatum and peduncle. Compared with CPNs, CSNs had slow conduction velocities and low spontaneous rates, and the activity of most was unmodulated by sensory testing or within the tasks used. CSN activity resembled that described for M1-recipient striatal neurons: perimovement firing was small in magnitude, strongly directional, and rarely showed muscle-like load effects. Contrary to a previous report, perimovement activity in most CSNs began before movement onset. CSN activity was more selective than that of CPNs: CSN sensory responses and perimovement activities were often directionally specific, CSNs were often activated exclusively by sensory stimulation, active movement, or movement preparation, and a substantial fraction of CSNs (19{\%}) was unresponsive to any task or manipulation. Thus, CSNs transmit signals distinct from those sent to spinal cord/brainstem. The highly selective activity of CSNs suggests that a discrete (i.e., sparse) code is used to signal cortical activation states to striatum.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the significance of the Goltz-Ferrier debates held at the International Medical Congress of 1881 for the development of ideas on cerebral localization. BACKGROUND: Cerebral localization was the subject of vigorous debate throughout the 19th century. At the Congress of 1881, David Ferrier, a leading proponent of cerebral localization, and Friedrich Leopold Goltz, an equally prominent anti-localizationist, had the opportunity to present their experimental research before 3,000 of the world's leading medical figures. METHODS: The authors reviewed and translated the presentations by Goltz and Ferrier at the Congress and supporting publications in contemporary medical journals. RESULTS: In his presentation to the Physiology Section, Goltz criticized localizationists for their widely divergent conclusions about the exact anatomic sites of cortical centers and for their failure to adequately explain functional restitution after cortical ablations. He noted that localizationist theories could, like an apple, "look very tempting and still have a worm inside." He described his own studies on massive decerebrations in dogs and noted that despite complete destruction of the cortices of both hemispheres these animals failed to exhibit motor weakness or deficits in primary sensation. Ferrier noted that Goltz's results were irreconcilable with his own experiments in monkeys, in which circumscribed lesions produced clear and reproducible functional deficits. Both investigators exhibited animals with cortical ablations. Ferrier's presentation of a hemiplegic monkey prompted Charcot's famous utterance, "C'est un malade!" ["It's a patient!"]. A distinguished committee examined the brains of the animals, and confirmed that Ferrier had indeed succeeded in producing a circumscribed lesion in the frontoparietal cortex, whereas the cortical ablations in Goltz's dogs were much less widespread than anticipated. CONCLUSIONS: Ferrier's dramatic demonstration of the effects produced by localized lesions in macaques triumphed over Goltz's unitary view of brain function, providing a major impetus for the subsequent successful development of neurologic surgery.},

@article{VonHofsten1989,
abstract = {This chapter deals with the development of reaching and grasping during the 1st year of life. As the maturation of the nervous system imposes the most severe constraints on this development, an attempt is first made to summarize what is known about the motor pathways and the sensorimotor systems involved in manual development. The chapter then sketches the presumed major steps in the manual development of the human infant. Visual control of arm movements is already present in newborn infants, but the arm and the hand are synergistically coupled in these movements. As the arm extends, the hand opens and vice versa. This synergy is broken up at about 2 months as infants start to fist the hand vigorously as the arm extends. That pattern gives way to a more functional one in which the hand opens up during arm extension in preparation for grasping an object. Around 4 months of age, infants start to reach and grasp objects successfully. Major changes in the organization of the manual movements accompany this event. Vision takes a more prominent role in the control of hand movements as the infant gains ability to monitor the hand relative to a target. The major change in manual control during the second half of the 1st year of life is the appearance of differentiated finger movements and the. ?? 1989 Academic Press Inc.},

abstract = {We have used a photochemical reaction in vivo to induce reproducible thrombosis leading to cerebral infarction in rats. After the intravenous injection of rose bengal, a potent photosensitizing dye, an ischemic lesion was formed by irradiating the left parietal convexity of the exposed skull for 20 minutes with green light (560 nm) from a filtered xenon arc lamp. Animals were allowed to survive from 30 minutes to 15 days after irradiation. Early microscopic alterations within the irradiated zone included the formation of thrombotic plugs and adjacent red blood cell stasis within pial and parenchymal vessels. Scanning electron microscopy revealed frequent platelet aggregates adhering to the vascular endothelium, often resulting in vascular occlusion. Carbon-black brain perfusion demonstrated that occlusion of vascular channels progressed after irradiation and was complete within 4 hours. Histopathological examination at 1, 5, and 15 days revealed that the associated infarct evolved reproducibly through several characteristic stages, including a phase of massive macrophage infiltration. Although cerebral infarction in this model is initiated by thrombosis of small blood vessels, the fact that the main pathological features of stroke are consistently reproduced should permit its use in assessing treatment regimens. Further, the capability of producing infarction in preselected cortical regions may facilitate the study of behavioral, functional, and structural consequences of acute and chronic stroke.},

abstract = {The rat medial agranular cortex (AGm) projects bilaterally to the striatum, mainly to the dorsocentral striatum (DCS) and in a narrow band in the far dorsolateral striatum (FDLS). For the projection from AGm to DCS, axonal and synaptic densities are known to be two times greater in the ipsilateral versus contralateral DCS, producing a contralateral to ipsilateral ratio of 0.5. In the present study we wished to determine if this was also the case for the projection from AGm to FDLS. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine were made into AGm in normal rats, and unbiased sampling was used to quantify the density of axons and axonal varicosities present in the FDLS. Unlike the contra/ipsi ratio of 0.5 found in DCS, the FDLS exhibited a contra/ipsi ratio of 1.0 for both axonal and synaptic densities. While overall axonal densities were roughly equivalent in ipsilateral and contralateral FDLS, axonal density in the ipsilateral FDLS was uniform, whereas density in the contralateral FDLS increased from the medial edge of the band to its boundary at the external capsule. These differences in the bilateral projections of AGm to separate striatal regions raise questions regarding the populations of corticostriatal neurons in AGm that contribute to these projections. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {We investigated whether direct, cortico-motoneuronal connections are present in the rat, using both light microscopic and electron microscopic techniques. Corticospinal fibres were labelled using the anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran-amine (BDA), which was injected into forelimb sensorimotor cortex. Motoneurons were retrogradely labelled after injection of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into forelimb muscles, contralateral to the injected hemisphere. Terminals of peripheral afferent fibres, which were also labelled by CTB, were easily distinguishable from, and much larger than, BDA-labelled corticospinal terminals. At the light microscope level, corticospinal terminals were found in all laminae contralateral to the injection site, most extensively in laminae VI and VII of cervical segments C5-C8. Although labelling in the ventral horn (lamina IX) was present, it was extremely sparse. A total of 47 corticospinal synapses were studied at the electron microscope level; most of these were in lamina VII and the majority (35/47; 74{\%}) made axo-dendritic contacts with asymmetrical synapses; one made an axo-somatic synapse, and in the remaining 11 cases no postsynaptic structure could be identified. All corticospinal terminals contained spherical boutons. Serial sectioning of eight BDA-labelled corticospinal boutons in lamina IX revealed that most (seven out of eight) did not make synaptic contacts with any neuronal structure, and none made any contact with adjacent dendrites of CTB-labelled motoneurons. Thus these results provide no positive ultrastructural evidence for direct cortico-motoneuronal synaptic connections within lamina IX between corticospinal axon boutons and the proximal dendrites of forelimb motoneurons. The results confirm other lines of evidence suggesting that such connections are not present in the rat.},

abstract = {Damage to the corticospinal tract is a leading cause of motor disability, for example in stroke or spinal cord injury. Some function usually recovers, but whether plasticity of undamaged ipsilaterally descending corticospinal axons and/or brainstem pathways such as the reticulospinal tract contributes to recovery is unknown. Here, we examined the connectivity in these pathways to motor neurons after recovery from corticospinal lesions. Extensive unilateral lesions of the medullary corticospinal fibres in the pyramidal tract were made in three adult macaque monkeys. After an initial contralateral flaccid paralysis, motor function rapidly recovered, after which all animals were capable of climbing and supporting their weight by gripping the cage bars with the contralesional hand. In one animal where experimental testing was carried out, there was (as expected) no recovery of fine independent finger movements. Around 6 months post-lesion, intracellular recordings were made from 167 motor neurons innervating hand and forearm muscles. Synaptic responses evoked by stimulating the unlesioned ipsilateral pyramidal tract and the medial longitudinal fasciculus were recorded and compared with control responses in 207 motor neurons from six unlesioned animals. Input from the ipsilateral pyramidal tract was rare and weak in both lesioned and control animals, suggesting a limited role for this pathway in functional recovery. In contrast, mono- and disynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials elicited from the medial longitudinal fasciculus significantly increased in average size after recovery, but only in motor neurons innervating forearm flexor and intrinsic hand muscles, not in forearm extensor motor neurons. We conclude that reticulospinal systems sub-serve some of the functional recovery after corticospinal lesions. The imbalanced strengthening of connections to flexor, but not extensor, motor neurons mirrors the extensor weakness and flexor spasm which in neurological experience is a common limitation to recovery in stroke survivors.},
