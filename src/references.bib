abstract = {What neural activity in motor cortex represents and how it controls ongoing movement remain unclear. Suggestions that cortex generates low-level muscle control are discredited by correlations with higher-level parameters of hand movement, but no coherent alternative exists. I argue that the view of low-level control is in principle correct, and that seeming contradictions result from overlooking known properties of the motor periphery. Assuming direct motor cortical activation of muscle groups and taking into account the state dependence of muscle-force production and multijoint mechanics, I show that cortical population output must correlate with hand kinematics in quantitative agreement with experimental observations. The model reinterprets the 'neural population vector' to afford unified control of posture, movement and force production.},

abstract = {We propose that some of the features of the topographic organization in motor cortex emerge from a competition among several conflicting mapping requisites. These competing requisites include a somatotopic map of the body, a map of hand location in space, and a partitioning of cortex into regions that emphasize different complex, ethologically relevant movements. No one type of map fully explains the topography; instead, all three influences (and perhaps others untested here) interact to form the topography. A standard algorithm (Kohonen network) was used to generate an artificial motor cortex array that optimized local continuity for these conflicting mapping requisites. The resultant hybrid map contained many features seen in actual motor cortex, including the following: a rough, overlapping somatotopy; a posterior strip in which simpler movements were represented and more somatotopic segregation was observed, and an anterior strip in which more complex, multisegmental movements were represented and the somatotopy was less segregated; a clustering of different complex, multisegmental movements into specific subregions of cortex that resembled the arrangement of subregions found in the monkey; three hand representations arranged on the cortex in a manner similar to the primary motor, dorsal premotor, and ventral premotor hand areas in the monkey; and maps of hand location that approximately matched the maps observed in the monkey.},

abstract = {The first motor (MI) cortex of the rat was identified as the region from which movements could be evoked by the lowest intensity of electrical stimulation. The location of this region was correlated with cytoarchitecture in the frontal and parietal cortex. Two frontal areas can be discerned in Nissl-stained sections: (1) the medial agranular field, marked by a pale-staining layer III and a compact layer II, and (2) the lateral agranular field, which has more homogeneous superficial layers and a broad layer V containing large, densely staining cells. Both of these regions project to the spinal cord and can therefore be included in the somatic sensorimotor cortex. MI in the rat coincides with the lateral agranular field but also overlaps with part of the adjacent granular cortex of the first somatic sensory (SI) representation. We conclude that the rat MI cortex can be identified by microstimulation techniques and by cytoarchitecture in the rat.},

abstract = {Most theories of motor cortex have assumed that neural activity represents movement parameters. This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.},

We investigated the functional role of the FOF using rats trained to perform a memory-guided orienting task, in which there was a delay period between the end of a sensory stimulus instructing orienting direction and the time of the allowed motor response. Unilateral inactivation of the FOF resulted in impaired contralateral responses. Extracellular recordings of single units revealed that 37% of FOF neurons had delay period firing rates that predicted the direction of the rats' later orienting motion. Our data provide the first electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence supporting the existence in the rat, as in the primate, of a frontal cortical area involved in the preparation and/or planning of orienting responses.},

abstract = {Rodents have primary and secondary motor cortices that are involved in the execution of voluntary movements via their direct and parallel projections to the spinal cord. However, it is unclear whether the rodent secondary motor cortex has any motor function distinct from the primary motor cortex to properly control voluntary movements. In the present study, we quantitatively examined neuronal activity in the caudal forelimb area (CFA) of the primary motor cortex and rostral forelimb area (RFA) of the secondary motor cortex in head-fixed rats performing forelimb movements (pushing, holding, and pulling a lever). We found virtually no major differences between CFA and RFA neurons, regardless of neuron subtypes, not only in their basal spiking properties but also in the time-course, amplitude, and direction preference of their functional activation for simple forelimb movements. However, the RFA neurons, as compared with the CFA neurons, showed obviously a greater susceptibility of their functional activation to an alteration in a behavioral situation, a 'rewarding' response that leads to reward or a 'consummatory' response that follows reward water, which might be accompanied by some internal adaptations without affecting the motor outputs. Our results suggest that, although the CFA and RFA neurons commonly process fundamental motor information to properly control forelimb movements, the RFA neurons may be functionally differentiated to integrate motor information with internal state information for an adaptation to goal-directed behaviors.},

abstract = {We investigated whether direct, cortico-motoneuronal connections are present in the rat, using both light microscopic and electron microscopic techniques. Corticospinal fibres were labelled using the anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran-amine (BDA), which was injected into forelimb sensorimotor cortex. Motoneurons were retrogradely labelled after injection of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into forelimb muscles, contralateral to the injected hemisphere. Terminals of peripheral afferent fibres, which were also labelled by CTB, were easily distinguishable from, and much larger than, BDA-labelled corticospinal terminals. At the light microscope level, corticospinal terminals were found in all laminae contralateral to the injection site, most extensively in laminae VI and VII of cervical segments C5-C8. Although labelling in the ventral horn (lamina IX) was present, it was extremely sparse. A total of 47 corticospinal synapses were studied at the electron microscope level; most of these were in lamina VII and the majority (35/47; 74%) made axo-dendritic contacts with asymmetrical synapses; one made an axo-somatic synapse, and in the remaining 11 cases no postsynaptic structure could be identified. All corticospinal terminals contained spherical boutons. Serial sectioning of eight BDA-labelled corticospinal boutons in lamina IX revealed that most (seven out of eight) did not make synaptic contacts with any neuronal structure, and none made any contact with adjacent dendrites of CTB-labelled motoneurons. Thus these results provide no positive ultrastructural evidence for direct cortico-motoneuronal synaptic connections within lamina IX between corticospinal axon boutons and the proximal dendrites of forelimb motoneurons. The results confirm other lines of evidence suggesting that such connections are not present in the rat.},

Rats spontaneously walk from a starting location to a goal along a horizontal ladder. The spacing between the rungs of the ladder is variable and can be changed to prevent the animal from learning either the absolute or relative location of the rungs. The testing procedure requires minimal training and allows detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis using video recording. The utility of the test is described with postoperative data obtained from animals with unilateral neocortical strokes produced by pial stripping over the motor cortex, neonatal and adult unilateral corticospinal tract lesions produced by tract section at the pyramids, and unilateral dopamine depletions produced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the nigrostriatal bundle. In addition, a group of aged rats was examined. Deficits in limb placing, stepping and co-ordination displayed by the animals demonstrate that this test can discriminate between lesions of the motor system or age-associated impairments. The test is useful for assessing loss and recovery of function due to brain or spinal cord injury, the effectiveness of treatment therapies, as well as compensatory processes through which animals adapt to nervous system injury.},

abstract = {Although the corticospinal tract is not essential for the production of the basic locomotor rhythm in cats, it does contribute to the regulation of locomotion, particularly in situations in which there is a requirement for precise control over paw placement or limb trajectory. Lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi at the low thoracic level (T(13)) that completely interrupted both the cortico- and rubrospinal pathways produced long-term deficits in locomotion on a level surface. These deficits included a paw-drag that was probably caused both by a loss of cortico- and rubrospinal input to motoneurones controlling distal muscles as well as by a change in the relative timing of muscles acting around the hip and knee. Smaller lesions produced similar deficits from which the cats recovered relatively quickly. Cats with the largest lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi were unable to modify their gait sufficiently to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt even 3-5 months postlesion. These results imply that the medial pathways, the reticulo- and vestibulospinal pathways, are unable to fully compensate for damage to the lateral pathways. Single unit recordings from identified pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) within the hindlimb representation of the primary motor cortex (area 4) showed that a substantial proportion of neurones (67%) significantly increased their discharge frequency when the cats modified their gait to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt. Of those PTNs that showed increased activity during the swing phase, populations of neurones were activated at different times. A large proportion of PTNS discharged early in swing, in phase with knee flexors such as the semitendinosus. Others discharged slightly later, in phase with the activity of ankle flexors, such as tibialis anterior, while still others discharged at the end of swing, in phase with digit dorsiflexors, such as the extensor digitorum brevis. We suggest that different populations of cortical neurones may specifically modify the activity of selected groups of close synergistic muscles during different parts of the swing phase. We further suggest that these modifications are mediated, in part, by groups of interneurones that are involved in determining the base locomotor rhythm. This provides a means by which the changes specified by the descending signal from the motor cortex may be smoothly, and appropriately, incorporated into the locomotor cycle.},
annote = {Lesions to both the corticospinal and rubrospinal pathways in cats cause long-lasting impairments when stepping over obstacles. Partial lesions recover quickly over one to two weeks.

Interestingly, it is not an absolute inability to lift the paw, as they will adapt stepping to higher obstacles. They still fail to successfully step over, but this partial step would be enough to clear the lower obstacle.

In humans, corticospinal is more pronounced, but rubrospinal is partially degenerated. Rubrospinal in primates may be compensating for lesions (hence difference between humans and primates).},

abstract = {One important aspect of locomotor control is the ability of an animal to make anticipatory gait modifications to avoid obstacles, by stepping either around them or over them. This paper reviews some of the evidence that suggests that the motor cortex is one of the principal structures involved in the control of such anticipatory gait modifications in cats, in particular when they are triggered by a visual signal. Evidence for this statement is provided both from experiments in which the motor cortex has been lesioned or inactivated and from studies in which the activity of motor cortical neurones has been recorded during locomotor tasks in which visual information is required to ensure the correct positioning of the paw or an appropriate modification of the limb trajectory. Inactivation of small regions of the motor cortex with the GABA agonist muscimol results in changes in the limb trajectory so that cats hit an obstacle instead of stepping over it as they do normally. A similar disruption of the hindlimb trajectory is seen following lesions of the spinal cord at T13 that interrupt the corticospinal tract. The results from cell recording studies are complementary in that they show that the activity of many identified pyramidal tract neurones increases when the cat is required to modify the forelimb or hindlimb trajectory to step over obstacles. We suggest that the major function of this increased discharge frequency is to regulate the amplitude, duration, and temporal pattern of muscle activity during the gait modification to ensure an appropriate modification of limb trajectory. We further suggest that different groups of pyramidal tract neurones are involved in regulating the activity of groups of synergistic muscles active at different times in the gait modification. For example, some groups of pyramidal tract neurones would be involved in ensuring the appropriate and sequential activation of the muscle groups involved in the initial flexion of the elbow, while others would be active prior to the repositioning of the paw on the support surface. We discuss the possibility that the motor cortical activity seen during locomotion is the sum result of a feedforward signal, which provides visuospatial information about the environment, and feedback activity, which signals, in part, the state of the interneuronal pattern generating networks in the spinal cord. The way in which the resulting descending command may interact with the basic locomotor rhythm to produce the gait modifications is discussed.},

abstract = {Over 30 years ago, Castro [(1972) Brain Res., 37, 173-185] proposed that motor cortex (MtCx) ablation produced deficits in digital usage that contributed to the rat's impairments in a reach-to-eat task, but the impairment was not directly documented. The present study examined digit use in control rats and rats with MtCx lesions using high-speed (1000 f/s) video recording. Temporal and spatial characteristics of individual digits were evaluated by digitizing the tip of the digits and digital joints using the motion measurement system Peak Motus. Control rats displayed differential digital use during grasping actions and MtCx damage reduced individual digit movement, both as the paw was pre-shaped for grasping and in the grasping action itself. The findings show that although grasping is retained following MtCx damage, MtCx is essential for dexterous movement. The results are discussed in relation to the idea that rodent MtCx is not only necessary for rotatory movements of the limb, but also for digital control and in relation to the similarities of rodent digit use to that described for primates.},

@article{Terry1989,
abstract = {Behavioural flexibility in decorticate rats was examined by testing response transfer in an obstructed alleyway. In the first experiment, rats were trained to push a ball out of a cylindrical alleyway in order to gain access to the goal box. When this 'push' habit was prevented by blocking forward movement of the ball, decorticate rats were much quicker than sham-operated rats in successfully developing the novel clearance response of pulling the ball into the start box. Both groups were subsequently able to reverse effectively between responses. In a second experiment, sham-operated and decorticate rats were first shaped to pull the ball clear from the alleyway, and then required to adopt a push-type clearance response when movement of the ball towards the start box was prevented. Here, the decorticates showed difficulty both in learning to pull the ball out of the alley and in transferring to a push-type clearance response, but having transferred they coped well with subsequent reversals. This asymmetrical pattern of transfer results is not readily attributed to response preference and raises the possibility that, in some situations at least, decorticated animals may show greater behavioural flexibility than had previously been supposed.},

@article{Lee2008,
abstract = {A prominent feature of thalamocortical circuitry in sensory systems is the extensive and highly organized feedback projection from the cortex to the thalamic neurons that provide stimulus-specific input to the cortex. In lightly sedated rats, we found that focal enhancement of motor cortex activity facilitated sensory-evoked responses of topographically aligned neurons in primary somatosensory cortex, including antidromically identified corticothalamic cells; similar effects were observed in ventral posterior medial thalamus (VPm). In behaving rats, thalamic responses were normally smaller during whisking but larger when signal transmission in brainstem trigeminal nuclei was bypassed or altered. During voluntary movement, sensory activity may be globally suppressed in the brainstem, whereas signaling by cortically facilitated VPm neurons is simultaneously enhanced relative to other VPm neurons receiving no such facilitation.},

abstract = {Since the area was first described by Fritsch and Hitzig,1 the function of the electrostimulable cortex of the cerebrum has been the subject of almost continuous controversy. The experiments were immediately called in question through criticisms of the technic by Dupuy,2 Sanderson,3 Carville and Duret,4 and others, or by abstruse metaphysical deductions such as were advanced by Hermann5 who objected to the motor area as violating the "unity of mind." The work of Ferrier,6 Carville and Duret and Hitzig soon established the fact of the electrical excitability of limited areas of the cortex, but immedi- ately a new question arose. Fritsch and Hitzig had considered the excitable zone as motor, if we may translate the expression, "entry of single psychic functions into material" by such a term. In this they were followed by Carville and Duret, who described the motor dis- turbances following lesions in the area as "paralysie de la motricit\l=e'\ volontaire corticale." Ferrier also considered the area as motor. But most of the early work had been done with dogs, and the sensory- disturbances which appear in this animal after ablation of the stim- ulable area were emphasized by Schiff,7 Nothnagel,8 Munk ° and Hitzig,10 who interpreted the disorders of movement variously as due to the loss of muscular and cutaneous sensitivity or to the loss of kinesthetic images of the movements to be performed.},

abstract = {A category of stimuli of great importance for primates, humans in particular, is that formed by actions done by other individuals. If we want to survive, we must understand the actions of others. Furthermore, without action understanding, social organization is impossible. In the case of humans, there is another faculty that depends on the observation of others' actions: imitation learning. Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism—the mirror-neuron mechanism—that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the mirror-neuron system and language.},

abstract = {Damage to the corticospinal tract is a leading cause of motor disability, for example in stroke or spinal cord injury. Some function usually recovers, but whether plasticity of undamaged ipsilaterally descending corticospinal axons and/or brainstem pathways such as the reticulospinal tract contributes to recovery is unknown. Here, we examined the connectivity in these pathways to motor neurons after recovery from corticospinal lesions. Extensive unilateral lesions of the medullary corticospinal fibres in the pyramidal tract were made in three adult macaque monkeys. After an initial contralateral flaccid paralysis, motor function rapidly recovered, after which all animals were capable of climbing and supporting their weight by gripping the cage bars with the contralesional hand. In one animal where experimental testing was carried out, there was (as expected) no recovery of fine independent finger movements. Around 6 months post-lesion, intracellular recordings were made from 167 motor neurons innervating hand and forearm muscles. Synaptic responses evoked by stimulating the unlesioned ipsilateral pyramidal tract and the medial longitudinal fasciculus were recorded and compared with control responses in 207 motor neurons from six unlesioned animals. Input from the ipsilateral pyramidal tract was rare and weak in both lesioned and control animals, suggesting a limited role for this pathway in functional recovery. In contrast, mono- and disynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials elicited from the medial longitudinal fasciculus significantly increased in average size after recovery, but only in motor neurons innervating forearm flexor and intrinsic hand muscles, not in forearm extensor motor neurons. We conclude that reticulospinal systems sub-serve some of the functional recovery after corticospinal lesions. The imbalanced strengthening of connections to flexor, but not extensor, motor neurons mirrors the extensor weakness and flexor spasm which in neurological experience is a common limitation to recovery in stroke survivors.},

abstract = {THIS REPORT DESCRIBES the third in a series of studies of the relation of discharge of pyramdal tract neurons (PTNs) to voluntary movement. The first of the previous studies (5) showed that PTN activity both at rest and during movement is related to axonal conduction velocity. PTNs with the highest axonal conduction velocities tend to be silent during motor quiescence and to show phasic activity in association with movement. PTNs with lower axonal conduction velocities are for the most part active even in the absence of movement; with movement they show both upward and downward modulation of their resting discharge frequency. A second study (6) was carried out to obtain information as to the point in the interval between stimulus and response at which PTN discharge takes place in association with a conditioned hand movement. It was found that for many PTNs, responses to the conditioned stimulus (the onset of a light) preceded the first peripheral electromyographic correlates of the condi- tioned response (wrist extension). The fact that these PTN responses preceded the electromyographic response showed that they were not consequent upon feedback resulting from the movement. The present study was intended to answer a third question concerning the way in which PTN activity is related to movement: Is the discharge of PTNs related to the force exerted by the moving part, or does PTN activity more nearly parallel the displacement which results from this force?},

abstract = {The relationship between neural activity in motor cortex and movement is highly debated. Although many studies have examined the spatial tuning (e.g., for direction) of cortical responses, less attention has been paid to the temporal properties of individual neuron responses. We developed a novel task, employing two instructed speeds, that allows meaningful averaging of neural responses across reaches with nearly identical velocity profiles. Doing so preserves fine temporal structure and reveals considerable complexity and heterogeneity of response patterns in primary motor and premotor cortex. Tuning for direction was prominent, but the preferred direction was frequently inconstant with respect to time, instructed-speed, and/or reach distance. Response patterns were often temporally complex and multiphasic, and varied with direction and instructed speed in idiosyncratic ways. A wide variety of patterns was observed, and it was not uncommon for a neuron to exhibit a pattern shared by no other neuron in our dataset. Response patterns of individual neurons rarely, if ever, matched those of individual muscles. Indeed, the set of recorded responses spanned a much higher dimensional space than would be expected for a model in which neural responses relate to a moderate number of factors-dynamic, kinematic, or otherwise. Complex responses may provide a basis-set representing many parameters. Alternately, it may be necessary to discard the notion that responses exist to "represent" movement parameters. It has been argued that complex and heterogeneous responses are expected of a recurrent network that produces temporally patterned outputs, and the present results would seem to support this view.},

abstract = {1. Monkeys were trained to trace sinusoids with their index fingers on a planar surface. During this task, both the direction and speed of movement varied continuously. Activity of individual units in the precentral gyrus contralateral to the moving arm was recorded as the task was performed. These cells responded to passive movement of the shoulder and/or elbow. The relation between discharge rate and movement direction for these individual cells could be described with a cosine tuning function. 2. Data recorded as the sinusoid was traced were divided into 100 bins as each cell was studied during the experiment. In each bin, the activity of a particular cell was represented by a vector. The vector ("cell vector") pointed in the direction of finger movement that corresponded to the highest rate of neuronal discharge. This direction, referred to as the preferred direction, corresponded to the peak of the cosine tuning function. The direction of the vector was constant between bins, but the magnitude of this cell's vector was a function of the instantaneous discharge rate. 3. This cell vector is a hypothetical contribution of a single cell to the population response comprised of 554 similarly derived vectors from different cells. The population response was represented as the vector that resulted from forming the sum of the vector contributions from the individual cells. A separate calculation was made for each bin, resulting in 100 population vectors for each sinusoid. 4. Within a given time series of population vectors, their lengths and directions varied in a consistent relation to the tangential velocity of the drawing movement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Skilled reaching movements are an important aspect of human motor behavior but are impaired after motor system stroke. The purpose of this study was to document skilled movements in mice before and after a focal motor cortex stroke for the purpose of developing a mouse model of human stroke. METHODS: Male C57/BL6 mice were trained to reach with a forelimb for food pellets and then given a motor cortex stroke, induced by pial stripping, contralateral to their preferred reaching limb. Reaching success and the movements used in reaching were analyzed by frame-by-frame inspection of presurgical and postsurgical video records. RESULTS: Reaching success was severely impaired after the stroke. Improvement in success over 2 postsurgical weeks was moderate. Analysis of 10 movement components comprising reaches pre- and postsurgically indicated that most of the rotatory movements of the limb used for aiming, advancing, pronating, and supinating the paw were impaired. When successful reaches did occur, body movements that compensated for the impairments in limb rotatory movements aided them. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that skilled reaching in the mouse is impaired by focal motor cortex stroke and they suggest that the mouse, and the skilled reaching task, provides an excellent model for studying impairments, compensation, and recovery after motor system stroke.},

abstract = {The distribution of corticospinal projection neurons in adult rats was determined using a retrograde tracing technique. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and an emulsifier (Nonidet) were injected into the 5th and 6th segments of the cervical spinal cord. The greatest concentrations of HRP-positive neurons were distributed in area 4 and rostral area 6/8 (motor cortices) and medial area 3 and caudal area 2 (somatosensory cortices). The largest labeled neurons were in areas 4 and 3. HRP-positive neurons were absent or few in regions of motor and somatosensory fields which contained the face representation. Less dense concentrations of retrogradely labeled neurons were also in posterior parietal and association areas 14, 39 and 40, rostral occipital visual areas 18a and 18b, and anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas 24a, 24b, and 32. The topography of the corticospinal pathway was determined by injecting HRP without Nonidet into the cervical, upper thoracic, lower thoracic, or lumbar spinal cord. Although the distribution of labeled neurons decreased with distance down the spinal cord, the size of the corticospinal neurons in each cytoarchitectonic area was not significantly different regardless of where the injection was placed. For example, upper thoracic cord injections retrogradely labeled neurons in each of the regions containing neurons filled by cervical cord injections, however, lumbar injections retrogradely labeled neurons only in caudal areas 4 and 3 and in area 18b. The distribution of corticospinal neurons in rats in similar to the organization of the corticospinal system in higher animals. The origin of corticospinal neurons in occipital and cingulate cortices may be related to visuomotor and visceromotor control.},

We find that, as a population, spike trains of single units in primary vibrissa motor cortex report the absolute angle of vibrissa position. This representation persists after sensory nerve transection, indicating an efferent source. About two-thirds of the units are modulated by slow variations in the envelope of whisking, while relatively few units report rapid changes in position within the whisk cycle. The combined results from this study and past measurements, which show that primary sensory cortex codes the whisking envelope as a motor copy signal, imply that signals present in both sensory and motor cortices are necessary to compute angular coordinates based on vibrissa touch. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We shall call this part of its operation FIGURE-GROUND analysis. It will be impossible to do this without considerable analysis of shape and surface properties, so FIGURE-GROUND analysis is really inseparable in practice from the second goal which is REGION DESCRIPTION. The final goal is OBJECT IDENTIFICATION which will actually name objects by matching them with a vocabulary of known objects.},

abstract = {Cortical-feedback projections to primary sensory areas terminate most heavily in layer 1 (L1) of the neocortex, where they make synapses with tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons. L1 input is thought to provide ‘contextual' information, but the signals transmitted by L1 feedback remain uncharacterized. In the rodent somatosensory system, the spatially diffuse feedback projection from vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) to vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1, also known as the barrel cortex) may allow whisker touch to be interpreted in the context of whisker position to compute object location. When mice palpate objects with their whiskers to localize object features, whisker touch excites vS1 and later vM1 in a somatotopic manner. Here we use axonal calcium imaging to track activity in vM1-->vS1 afferents in L1 of the barrel cortex while mice performed whisker-dependent object localization. Spatially intermingled individual axons represent whisker movements, touch and other behavioural features. In a subpopulation of axons, activity depends on object location and persists for seconds after touch. Neurons in the barrel cortex thus have information to integrate movements and touches of multiple whiskers over time, key components of object identification and navigation by active touch.},

Overall, around 40% of excitatory and 60% of inhibitory modulations in neuronal activity began prior to reach onset. These data are consistent with a role for rat motor cortex in the initiation and control of the reaching movement. In addition, although the reach only lasted a short time, 30% of excitations and inhibitions began while it was in progress. The existence of such modulations occurring during the reach is consistent with previous data showing activity of cortical neurons late in the reach, and suggests a heavy involvement of cortical neurons in controlling the recently described, complex movements associated with grasping that are seen in the rat. These features were broadly similar in neurones from both the caudal and rostral subdivisions of rat motor cortex.},
