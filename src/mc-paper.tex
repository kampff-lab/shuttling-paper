\begin{abstract}
The role of motor cortex in the direct control of movement remains unclear, particularly in lower mammals. More than a century of research using stimulation, anatomical and electrophysiological studies has implicated neural activity in this region with all kinds of movements. However, following removal of motor cortex, or indeed the entire cortex, rats retain the ability to execute a surprisingly large range of adaptive overt movements, including previously learned skilled movements. In this work we revisit the functional meaning of these two parallel conflicting tracks of motor cortical research and ask what is the primordial role of motor cortex in non-primate mammals and how it can be effectively assayed. In order to motivate the discussion we present a new assay and behavioural dataset in the rat, challenging animals to produce robust responses to unexpected and unpredictable situations during locomotion across a dynamic obstacle course. Surprisingly, we found that rats with motor cortical lesions show clear impairments in dealing with an unexpected collapse of the obstacles, while showing virtually no impairment with repeated trials in many other motor and cognitive metrics of performance used to evaluate adaptive locomotion. We propose a new role for motor cortex: extending the robustness of sub-cortical movement systems specifically to unexpected situations demanding rapid motor responses adapted to environmental context and discuss the implications of this idea for current and future research.
