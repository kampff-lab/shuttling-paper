\section{Review}

It wasn't until the 1870s that the first indications of a direct involvement of the cortex in the production of movement came to light, around the time when Hughlings Jackson underwent his studies on epileptic convulsions \cite{Jackson1870}. He observed that in some patients the fits would start by a deliberate spasm on one side of the body, and that different body parts would become systematically affected one after the other. He connected the orderly march of these spasms to the existence of localized lesions in the \emph{post-mortem} brain of his patients and hypothesized that the origin of these fits was uncontrolled excitation caused by local changes in cortical grey matter \cite{Jackson1870}. In that same year, Fritsch and Hitzig published their famous study demonstrating that it is possible to elicit movements by direct stimulation of the cortex in dogs \cite{Fritsch1870}. Furthermore, stimulation of different parts of the cortex produced movement in different parts of the body \cite{Fritsch1870}. It appeared that the causal mechanism for epileptic convulsions predicted by Hughlings Jackson had been found, and with it a possible explanation for how the normal brain might control movement. By this time the cerebral cortex was already considered to be the seat of reasoning and sensations, so if activity over this so-called \emph{motor cortex} was able to exert direct control over the whole musculature of the body, then it might represent in the normal brain the area that connects volition to muscles \cite{Fritsch1870}.

David Ferrier, a Scottish neurologist deeply impressed by the ideas of Hughlings Jackson and by the positive results of Fritsch and Hitzig's experiments, proceeded to reproduce and expand on their observations across a wide range of mammalian species \cite{Ferrier1873}. However, while Ferrier's comprehensive stimulation studies were showing how activity in the motor cortex was sufficient to produce a large variety of movements, other researchers like Goltz were reporting how massive cortical lesions failed to demonstrate any visible long-term impairments in the motor behaviour of animals \cite{Goltz1888}. These two lines of inquiry first clashed at the seventh International Medical Congress held in London in August 1881, where both Goltz and Ferrier presented their results in a series of debates on the localization of function in the cerebral cortex \cite{Tyler2000}.

Goltz assumed a clear anti-localizationist position. He advanced that it was impossible to produce a complete paresis of any muscle, or complete dysfunction of any perception, by destruction of any part of the cerebral cortex, and that he found mostly deficits of general intelligence in his dogs \cite{Tyler2000}. Following Goltz's presentation, Ferrier emphasized the danger of generalizing from the dog to animals of other orders (e.g. man and monkey). He then proceeded to exhibit his own lesion results by means of antiseptic surgery in the monkey, describing how a circumscribed unilateral lesion of the motor cortex produced complete contralateral paralysis of the leg. He also produced a striking series of microscopic sections of Wallerian degeneration \cite{Waller1850} of the ``motor path'' from the cortex to the contralateral spinal cord, the crossed descending projections forming the pyramidal corticospinal tract \cite{Tyler2000}.

The debates concluded with the public demonstration of live specimens: a dog with large lesions to the parietal and posterior lobes from Goltz; and from Ferrier, a hemiplegic monkey with a unilateral lesion to the motor cortex of the contralateral side. As predicted, Goltz's dog showed a clear ability to locomote and avoid obstacles and to make use of its other basic senses, while displaying peculiar deficits of intelligence such as failing to respond with fear to the cracking of a whip or ignoring tobacco smoke blown to its face. On the other hand, Ferrier's monkey showed up severely hemiplegic, in a condition similar to human stroke patients. After the demonstrations, the animals were killed and their brains removed. Preliminary observations revealed that the lesions in Goltz's dog were less extensive than expected, particularly on the left hemisphere. Ferrier's lesions on the other hand were precisely circumscribed to the contralateral motor cortex. These demonstrations secured the triumph of Ferrier, who went on to firmly establish the localizationist approach to neurology and the idea of a somatotopic arrangement over the motor cortex.
