\caption{An obstacle course for rodents. (\textbf{A}) Schematic of the apparatus and summary of the different conditions in the behaviour protocol. Animals shuttle back and forth between two reward ports at either end of the enclosure. (\textbf{B}) Schematic of the locking mechanism that allows each individual step to be made stable or unstable on a trial-by-trial basis. (\textbf{C}) Example video frame from the behaviour tracking system. Coloured overlays represent regions of interest and feature traces extracted automatically from the video.}

A lesion was considered ``large'' if the total lesion volume was above \SI{15}{\milli\meter\cubed}. (\textbf{C}) Super-imposed reconstruction stacks for all the small lesions.

Asterisks indicate sessions where there was a change in assay conditions during the session (see text). In these transition sessions, the average performance on the 20 trials immediately preceding the change is shown to the left of the solid vertical line whereas the performance on the remainder of that session (after the change) is shown to the right.}

Performance of the other groups is shown for comparison. (\textbf{B}) Average number of slips per crossing in early versus late sessions of the stable condition. Animals adopting a jumping strategy (both lesions and controls; see text) were not included in this analysis as jumping increased the probability of incorrect paw placement independently of proficiency.}

The position of the animal's nose is extracted whenever the paw activates the ROI of the first manipulated step (see methods). (\textbf{B}) The horizontal position, i.e. progression, of the nose in single trials for one of the control animals stepping across the different conditions of the shuttling protocol. (\textbf{C}) Average horizontal position of the nose across the different protocol stages for both lesion and control animals. Asterisks indicate the average nose position on the 20 trials immediately preceding a change in protocol conditions (see text). (\textbf{D}) Distribution of horizontal position against speed for the last two days of the stable (blue) and unstable (orange) protocol stages.
