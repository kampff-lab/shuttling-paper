\caption{\textbf{Rats adapt their postural approach to the obstacles after a change in physics.} A) Schematic of postural analysis image processing. A ``step'' is detected when a paw of the animal activates the blue ROI. At that moment, we extract the position of the animal's nose (marked in red; see methods). B) The average position of the nose across sessions where the environment was stable and C) after the environment changed to unstable. The asterisk indicates the average in the first 20 trials before the environment changed from stable to unstable. D) Distribution of nose positions for all control animals in the last two days of the stable and unstable protocol stages. Respectively for E) large lesions and F) small lesions.}
