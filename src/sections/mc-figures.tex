\caption{An obstacle course for rodents. (\textbf{A}) Schematic of the apparatus and of the different conditions in the behaviour protocol. Animals shuttle back and forth between two reward ports. (\textbf{B}) Schematic of the locking mechanism allowing each individual step to be made stable or unstable on a trial-by-trial basis. (\textbf{C}) Example video frame from the behaviour tracking system. Coloured overlays represent regions of interest and feature traces extracted automatically from the video. }

A lesion was considered ``large'' if the total lesion volume was above \SI{15}{\milli\meter\cubed}. (\textbf{C}) Super-imposed reconstruction stacks for all the small lesions.

(\textbf{A}) Average time to cross the obstacles on the different protocol stages for forelimb motor cortex lesions and control animals. Each set of three coloured bars represents the average performance on a single session. Asterisks indicate sessions where there was a change in protocol conditions (see text). In those sessions, the average performance on the 20 trials immediately preceding the change is shown to the left of the solid vertical line whereas the performance on the remainder of that session (after the change) is shown to the right. (\textbf{B}) Average time required to cross the obstacles in the stable condition for extended lesions. Performance of the other groups is shown for comparison.}

The position of the animal's nose is extracted whenever the paw activates the ROI of the first manipulated step (see methods). (\textbf{B}) The position of the nose in single trials for one of the control animals stepping across the different conditions of the shuttling protocol. (\textbf{C}) Average position of the nose across the different protocol stages for both lesion and control animals. Asterisks indicate the average nose position on the 20 trials immediately preceding a change in protocol conditions (see text). (\textbf{D}) Distribution of nose positions for control animals in the last two days of the stable (blue) and unstable (orange) protocol stages. Respectively for (\textbf{E}) small lesions and (\textbf{F}) large lesions.}
