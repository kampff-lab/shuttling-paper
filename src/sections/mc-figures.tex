Animals shuttle back and forth between two reward ports at either end of the enclosure. (\textbf{B}) Schematic of the locking mechanism that allows each individual step to be made stable or unstable on a trial-by-trial basis. (\textbf{C}) Example video frame from the behaviour tracking system. Coloured overlays represent regions of interest and feature traces extracted automatically from the video.}

\caption{Overall performance on the obstacle course is similar for both lesion and control animals. (\textbf{A}) Average time to cross the obstacles on the different protocol stages for forelimb motor cortex lesions and control animals. Each set of three coloured bars represents the average performance on a single session. Asterisks indicate sessions where there was a change in assay conditions during the session (see text). In these transition sessions, the average performance on the 20 trials immediately preceding the change is shown to the left of the solid vertical line whereas the performance on the remainder of that session (after the change) is shown to the right.

(\textbf{B}) Average time required to cross the obstacles in the stable condition for extended lesions. Performance of the other groups is shown for comparison. (\textbf{C}) Average number of slips per crossing in early versus late sessions of the stable condition. Animals adopting a jumping strategy (both lesions and controls; see text) were not included in this analysis as jumping increased the probability of incorrect paw placement independently of proficiency.}

(\textbf{B}) The horizontal position, i.e. progression, of the nose in single trials for one of the control animals stepping across the different conditions of the shuttling protocol. (\textbf{C}) Average horizontal position of the nose across the different protocol stages for both lesion and control animals. Asterisks indicate the average nose position on the 20 trials immediately preceding a change in protocol conditions (see text).
