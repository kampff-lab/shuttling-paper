\section{Experiment Discussion}

In this experiment, we assessed the role of motor cortical structures by making targeted lesions to areas responsible for forelimb control (cite Kawai and Otchy). (Put the following in annotation of Otchy) Assaying the relevance of a brain structure has long involved surgical lesions of specific structures and subsequent detailed analysis of any behavioural deficits. This method is not without its difficulties. The problems of plasticity and diaschisis will forever complicate conclusions based on injury and manipulations of nervous tissue. Many recent methods for reversible chemical or optogenetic inactivation of the cortex have been proposed to improve statistical power of behavioural assessments. Unfortunately, given that the cortex maintains a tight balance of excitation and inhibition during normal functioning and is also densely interconnected with the rest of the brain, the effects of such transient manipulations are prone to cause multiple downstream effects that can confound inferences about behavioural relevance \cite{Otchy2015}. In this respect, they are similar to stimulation experiments in that they are very useful in determining that two areas are connected in a circuit, but not necessarily what the connection means. Of course, permanent lesions themselves can induce plasticity changes in the function of downstream and upstream circuits but such changes should represent a homeostatically stable state of the system. In this way, we hope to simultaneously probe the limits of recovery, as well as the kinds of problems for which a fully intact structure is definitely required.

Consistent with previous studies, we did not observe any conspicuous deficits in movement execution for rats with bilateral motor cortex lesions when negotiating a stable environment. Even when exposed to very unstable obstacles, all animals were able to learn an efficient strategy for crossing these more challenging environments, with or without motor cortex. These movement strategies include a preparatory component that seems to reflect the state of the world an animal expects to encounter. Surprisingly, these preparatory responses also did not require the presence of motor cortex.

It was only when the environment did not conform to expectation, and demanded a rapid adjustment, that a difference between the lesion and control groups was obvious. Animals with extensive damage to the motor cortex did not deploy a change in strategy. Rather, they halted their progression for several seconds, unable to robustly respond to the new motor challenge. In an ecological setting, such hesitation could easily prove fatal.

\section{Discussion}

Is ``robust control'' a problem worthy of high level motor cortical input? Recovering from a perturbation, to maintain balance or minimize the impact of a fall, is a role normally assigned to our lower level postural control system. The corrective responses embedded in our spinal cord networks (cite: knee jerk sherrington), brainstem (cite: vestibular red nucleus) and midbrain (cite: grillner MLR) are clearly important components of this stabilizing process, but are they sufficient to maintain robust movement within the complex environments we encounter, and elegantly negotiate, on a daily basis? Some insight into the requirements of such a robust control system can be gained from engineering attempts to build robots that can navigate in natural environments.

In the field of robotics, feats of precision and fine movement control (the most commonly prescribed role for motor cortex), are not a major source of difficulty. Industrial robots have long since exceeded human performance in both accuracy and execution speed. More recently, using reinforcement learning methods, they are now able to learn efficient movement strategies automatically, given a human-defined goal and many repeated trials for fine-tuning. What then are the hard problems in robotic motor control? Why are most robots still confined to factories, i.e. controlled, predictable environments? The reason is that as soon as a robot goes mobile and needs to negotiate natural terrain, a vast number of previously unknown situations arise. The non-linearities inherent to these unexpected states and resulting ``perturbations'' are dealt with poorly by the statistical machine learning models that are currently used to train robots in controlled settings.

Let us consider a familiar example: You are up early on a Sunday morning and head outside to collect the newspaper. It is cold out, so you put on a robe and some slippers, open the front door, and descend the steps leading down to the street in front of your house. Unbeknownst to you, a thin sheet of ice has formed overnight and your foot is now quickly sliding out from underneath you. You are about to fall. What do you do? Well, this depends. Is there a railing you can grab to catch yourself? Were you carrying a cup of coffee? Did you notice the frost on the lawn and step more cautiously, anticipating a slippery surface? Avoiding a dangerous fall, or recovering gracefully, requires a rich knowledge of the world, knowledge that is not immediately available to spinal or even brainstem circuits. This rich context relevant for movement is instantly available, in real-time, to cortex, and cortex alone.

Imagine now that you were tasked with building a robot to collect your morning newspaper. This robot, in order to avoid a catastrophic and costly failure would need to have all of this contextual knowledge as well. It would need to know about the structure of the local environment (hand railings that can support its weight), hot liquids and their viscosities, and even the correlation of frozen dew with icy surfaces. To be a truly robust movement machine, a robot must understand the world.

(Flesh out in thesis; possibly add section Implications for robotic control systems)
There is a reason why flying drones took off much sooner than terrestrial robots: they face a much more linear, and predictable, control problem. We now have autopilots for every stage of flight, and yet we still demand a human at the helm of every aeroplane, even with all the risks associated with the human condition. We simply do not trust machines to face unexpected situations on which they have never been trained before, or to make a quick assessment of a novel situation and realize the implications of a change in context. And perhaps unsurprisingly, context can have dramatic implications on the effects of motor control execution that go way beyond precision in fine movements.

Reaching to stop the fall of a cup of coffee that unexpectedly falls from the table is also not exactly the kind of feat for which we praise our athletes and sports champions, which might explain why the difficulty of this problem has been under appreciated. It would not be the first time that we find ourselves humbled by a problem we consider ``trivial''. Vision, for example, has remained an impressively hard task for a machine to solve at human-level performance, yet it was originally proposed as an undergraduate summer project \cite{Papert1966}, around the same time when machines started beating our best minds at intellectual board games \cite{Samuel1959}.

\subsubsection*{A primordial role for motor cortex}

We are seeking a role for motor cortex in lower (non-primate) mammals, animals that do not appear to require this structure for overt movement production. The struggles of roboticists highlight the challenge of building movement systems that robustly adapt to unexpected perturbations and the results we report in this study suggest that this is, indeed, the most conspicuous deficit of rats lacking motor cortex. So let us propose that, in rodents, motor cortex is primarily responsible for extending the robustness of the sub-cortical movement systems. It is not required for control in stable, predictable, non-perturbing environments, but instead specifically exerts its influence when unexpected challenges arise. This, we propose, was the original selective pressure for evolving a motor cortex, and thus its primordial role. This role persists in lower mammals, mediated via a modulation of the subcortical motor system as emphasized in cat studies of locomotion, and has been elaborated upon in primates to include direct control over skeletal musculature. Our proposal of a ``robust'' teleology for motor cortex has a number of interesting implications.

\subsubsection*{Implications for lower mammals}

One of the most impressive traits of mammals is the vast range of environmental niches that they occupy. While most other animals adapt to change over evolutionary time scales, mammals excel in their individual flexibility to quickly evaluate and respond to unexpected situations, taking chances even when faced with challenges that have never been previously encountered by other conspecifics. Against all odds, mammals are able to thrive in such environments. This success requires more than precision, it requires resourcefulness, the ability to quickly come up with a motor solution for any situation and in any condition \cite{Bernstein1996}. Bernstein referred to this ability with his unconventional definition of ``dexterity'', which he considered to be distinct from simple harmony or precision in movements. In his words, dexterity is required only when there is \enquote{a conglomerate of unexpected, unique complications in the external situations, in a quick succession of motor tasks that are all unlike each other} \cite{Bernstein1996}.

If such ``robust dexterity'' is the primary role for motor cortex, then it becomes clear why the effects of lesions have thus far been so hard to characterize: assays of motor behaviour typically evaluate situations that are repeated over many trials, in the same environment. Such repeated tasks were necessary, as they offer improved statistics for quantification and comparison. However, these conditions seem to specifically exclude the scenarios for which motor cortex originally evolved. It is not easy to repeatedly produce conditions that animals have not previously encountered, and the challenges in analysing such unique situations are considerable.

The assay reported here represents our first attempt at such an experiment, and it has already revealed that such conditions may indeed be necessary to isolate the role of motor cortex. We thus propose that neuroscience should pursue similar assays, emphasizing unexpected perturbations and novel challenges, and we have worked on developing new hardware and software tools to make their design much easier \cite{Lopes2015a}.

\subsubsection*{Implications for primate studies}

In contrast to lower mammals, primates rely on motor cortex for the direct control of movement. However, do they also retain its role in generating robust responses? The general paresis, or even paralysis, that results from motor cortical lesions in primates will trivially obscure any of its involvement in directing rapid responses to perturbations. Yet there is still evidence that a role in robust control is also present in primates, including humans. For example, stroke patients with partial lesions to the distributed motor cortical system will often recover the ability to move the affected body parts. However, even after recovering movement, stroke patients are still prone to devastating errors in robust control. In fact, unsupported falls are one of the leading causes of injury and death in patients surviving motor cortical stroke \cite{Jacobs2014}. We thus suggest that stroke therapy, currently focused on regaining direct movement control, should also consider strategies for improving these robust responses.

Even if we acknowledge that a primordial role of motor cortex is still apparent in primate movement control, it remains to be explained why the motor cortex of these species has acquired control of basic movements. This remains an open question, but the consequences are intriguing.


What happens when cortex acquires direct control of movement? First, it must learn how to use this influence, which may explain the extended developmental times required for primates to produce basic motor control. Human babies require years of practice to produce simple locomotion and grasping [cite], motor behaviours that are available to lower mammals almost immediately after birth. This may be the cost of giving cortex control, it takes time to figure out how to move the body, so what is the benefit? 

A robust control system (i.e. cortex), in full command of the body, is capable of negotiating more difficult environmental niches. Primates may have been able to ascend trees, and avoid their less ``dexterous'' predators, with a feat of motor cortical control. However, the implications of this cortical ``take-over'' are potentially even more profound. 

If cortex has direct control of overt movements, then observing the behaviour of a primate constitutes direct observation of commands arising in cortex (vs. sub-cortical pattern generators). In other words, when you watch a primate move you are directly observing cortical commands. Now, if a species reliant on direct cortical control happened to live in social groups, then members of this group would have a uniquely efficient means of observing the state of cortex in a conspecific; what was going on in cortex would be directly observable in the movements of that individual. The implications of establishing an efficient means of ``communicating'' the state of one cortex to another are simply exhilarating to imagine...

\subsubsection*{Some Conclusions}

Clearly our results are insufficient to draft a final conclusion, but that is not our goal. We present our experiments to support and motivate our effort to distil a long history of research, and ultimately suggest a new approach to investigating the role of motor cortex. This approach most directly applies to studies of lower mammals. There is now a host of techniques to monitor and manipulate cortical activity during behaviour in these animals, but we propose that we should be monitoring and manipulating activity during behaviours that actually require motor cortex.

This synthesis also has implications for human studies. We suggest that acknowledging a primary role for motor cortex in robust control, a problem still daunting to robotics engineers, can guide the development of new approaches to building intelligent machines, as well as new strategies to assess and treat patients with motor cortical damage. We concede that our results are still naïf, but propose that the implications are worthy of your consideration.
