\section{Discussion}

Consistent with the previous locomotion studies outlined in the introduction, we did not observe any noticeable effects in movement execution over stable environments. Even when exposed to much harder, unstable, environments, all animals were able to learn, over time, an efficient control strategy for locomotion that was capable enough to overcome even the most challenging obstacles, with or without motor cortex. These movement strategies seem to include a preparatory component that takes into account the expected state of the world the animal will encounter. Surprisingly, these preparatory responses did not depend on the presence of frontal cortical structures in these animals.

It was only when the environment did not conform to expectation and demanded a rapid response and change in strategy, that a difference between the two groups of animals could be seen. Animals with extensive damage to the motor cortex were unable to rapidly deploy a change in strategy. Rather, they halted their progression for several seconds, apparently unable to decide on a suitable next strategy. In an ecological situation, such hesitation could easily prove fatal.

Is this the kind of problem worthy of higher level motor cortical control? Deploying a rapid motor response such as grabbing the handrail when slipping off the stairs or reaching to stop the fall of a cup of coffee that unexpectedly falls from the table is not exactly the kind of feat for which we praise our athletes and sports champions. However, if we consider how research into the field of building intelligent machines as progressed so far, it would not be the first time that we find ourselves humbled by how hard the problems that we consider trivial really are. Vision for example, remains an impressively hard problem for a machine to perform at human-level performance, while we can now routinely build computers that are able to beat our best minds at intellectual games such as chess, checkers and go. In fact, it seems that it is harder to get a robot to actually ``see'' the state of the board game and use its own hands to grab the pieces and move them, than to actually compute the best strategy for winning the game.

Conversely, in the field of robotics, feats of precision and fine movements are not the major sources of difficulty. For many years industrial robots have been pushing past human performance in both accuracy and speed of movement execution. More recently, using reinforcement learning techniques, they are even able to learn such movement strategies automatically, provided the environment is stable enough and many repeated trials are available for fine-tuning. What are then the hard problems for robotic motor control? Clearly most robots are still confined to industrial factories and controlled spaces. The reason is that as soon as a mobile robot needs to walk on land, a vast number of non-linear, previously unknown situations quickly present themselves. Especially for bipedal platforms, the non-linearities in dealing with these unexpected situations generalize extremely poorly from the statistical machine learning models that can be trained in controlled situations. There is a reason why flying drones took off much sooner than land robots: they face a much more linear, and predictable, control problem. And yet, even today we demand that there is a human at the helm of every aeroplane, even though we have autopilots for every stage of flight, even with all the risks associated with the human condition. One reason for this that seems relatively consensual is that we simply do not trust machines to face unexpected situations on which they have never been trained before. We don't yet trust a machine to make a quick assessment of a novel situation and realize the implications of a change in context. And perhaps unsurprisingly, context can have dramatic implications on the effects of motor control execution that go way beyond precision in fine movements.

Clearly our results are insufficient to make any outstanding and final conclusions at this point. The challenge of analysing behaviour in unique situations is considerable and indeed places an unfair burden on the familiar statistical methods that have been used for its evaluation. However, we believe that the development of new tools and assays to tackle these challenges will point towards new directions of research that, as we observed already in this simple experiment, can provide fundamental insight into critical problems of motor control that may until now have been largely ignored. Ultimately, they may also help to elucidate and better clarify other symptoms of motor cortical injury that have until know eluded our understanding of the role of this structure.
