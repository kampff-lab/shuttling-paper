\section{Results}

Histological examination of the lesions revealed significant variability in the extent of affected areas, which were in some cases traced back to spurious mechanical blockage of the injection pipette. Nevertheless, volume reconstruction of the serial sections allowed us to quantify the size of each lesion and use these values to interpret any observed behavioural effects as a function of lesion size.

During the first training sessions in the ``stable'' environment, all animals, both lesions and controls, quickly learned to shuttle across the obstacles and decreased both the time between collected rewards, as well as time taken to cross the obstacles, achieving stable, skilled performance after a few days of training. After only a few encounters with the obstacles, animals quickly adapted their stride length in order to facilitate crossing. Even though the distance between steps was fixed for all animals, the time taken to adapt the crossing strategy was similar irrespective of body size.

When first encountering the obstacles, animals adopted a cautious gait, investigating the location of the subsequent obstacle with their whiskers, stepping with the leading forepaw followed by a step to the same position with the trailing paw. However, over the course of a couple of trials, all animals exhibited a new strategy of ``stepping over'' the planted forepaw to the next obstacle, suggesting an increased confidence in their movement strategy in this new environment.

This more confident gait developed into a coordinated locomotion sequence after a few additional training sessions. The development of the ability to move confidently and quickly over the obstacle course was observed in both lesions and control animals. Surprisingly, we did not observe noticeable deficits in paw placement in the lesioned animals compared to controls as previously reported following pyramidal tract section.

In order to evaluate whether the ability to navigate this stable environment depended on motor cortical representations of trunk and hindlimbs, we included five additional animals, three with larger frontal thermocoagulation lesions and two with much more extensive cortical aspiration lesions. In these animals, there were immediately observable effects on paw placement upon the first encounter with the obstacles. However, over the course of ten repeated trials, this impairment recovered dramatically, up to the point where animals were moving as efficiently, and in fact in many cases even more efficiently, than control animals. These observations seem to indicate the presence of motor learning and not simply an increase in confidence with the new environment. The initial movement defects seem to be consistent with results from sectioning the entire pyramidal tract in cats, and as observed in these studies, quickly disappeared over the course of a few trials.

In subsequent training sessions we progressively increased the difficulty of the obstacle course, by progressively making more steps in the course unstable. The goal was to compare the performance of the two groups as a function of difficulty. Surprisingly, both lesion and control animals were able to improve their performance by the end of each training stage even for the most extreme conditions where all steps were made unstable. This seems to indicate that the ability for these animals to fine-tune their motor performance remained intact.

One noticeable exception was the animal with the largest ibotenic acid lesion. This animal, following exposure to the first unstable protocol, was unable to bring himself to cross the obstacle course. Some control animals experienced the same kind of distress following exposure to the first manipulation, but eventually all managed to start crossing the obstacles again over the course of a day. In order to test whether this was due to some kind of motor disability, we lowered the difficulty of the protocol for this one animal until he was able to cross again. Following the random permutation protocol, this animal was able to get itself to cross a single released obstacle placed in any location of the assay. After this success, he eventually learned to cross the highest difficulty level in the assay in about the same time as all the other animals, which convinced us that there was indeed no observable motor execution or learning deficit, and that the disability must have been due to some other unknown cognitive factor.

Having established that the overall motor performance of these animals was the same across all conditions, we next asked whether there was any difference in the strategy used by the two groups of animals to cross the obstacles. We noticed that during the first week of training, the posture of the animals when stepping on the obstacles changed significantly over time. Specifically, the centre of gravity of the body was shifted forward and higher in latter days, in a manner proportional to performance. However, after the first manipulation, we observed an immediate and persistent adjustment of this posture, with animals assuming a lowered centre of gravity as they resumed shuttling across the obstacle course. Interestingly, we noticed that a group of animals adopted a different strategy. Instead of lowering their centre of gravity, they either kept it unchanged or shifted it even more forward and performed a jump over the affected obstacles. These two strategies were remarkably consistent across the two groups of animals but there was no correlation between the strategy used and the degree of motor cortical lesion. In fact, we found the best predictor of whether an animal was a ``jumper'' to be the body weight of the animal.

During the two days where the stable state of the environment was reinstated before the randomized protocol, the posture of the animals was gradually restored to pre-manipulation levels, although at a much slower rate than the transition from stable to unstable. Again, this postural adaptation was independent of the presence or absence of forepaw motor cortex.

We next turned to look in detail at the days where the state of the obstacle course was randomized on a trial-by-trial basis. This stage of the protocol is particularly interesting as it reflects a situation where the environment has a persistent degree of uncertainty. For this analysis, we were forced to exclude the animals that employed a jumping strategy, as their approach to the obstacles was the same irrespective of the state of the world. First, we repeated the same posture analysis comparing all the stable and unstable trials in the random protocol in order to control for whether there was any cue in our motorized setup that the animals might be using to gain information about the state of the world. There was no significant effect between stable and unstable trials on the posture of the animal. However, by classifying the trials on the basis of past trial history, a significant effect on posture was obtained, which became more pronounced the more consistent the history was. This suggested to us that the animals might be adjusting their body posture when stepping on the affected obstacles on the basis of their current expectation about the state of the world. Surprisingly, this effect again did not depend on the presence or absence of frontal motor cortical structures.

Finally, we decided to test whether motor strategies were differentially affected by the state of the obstacles. If the animals do not know beforehand what state the world will be in, this means that there might be an increased challenge to the stability of the motor plant when they cross over the affected steps that might demand a quick change in strategy. In order to evaluate the dynamics of crossing, we measured the speed at which the animals were moving at each point in the assay, aligned on the first manipulated step. Consistent with the past history effect discussed above, there was also a consistent difference in the speed with which the animals approached the obstacles, depending on the state of the world in the previous trial. In order to normalize for this absolute change in speed we used the average speed with which the animal approached the step as a baseline and subtracted it from the overall profile for each trial. In order to summarize the difference between stable and unstable trials for each animal, we subtracted the speed in unstable trials from the speed in stable trials at each position in the assay and computed the sum of this measure for all trials. Interestingly, two of the largest lesions appeared to be significantly slowed down on unstable trials, while controls or the smallest lesions instead tended to speed up in response to a perturbation. However, the overall effect is not statistically significant and both animals clearly display the same comparable overall performance in both situations.

Nevertheless, we were intrigued by this small effect and decided to investigate in detail the single moment in the assay where the effect of a perturbation should be the largest and which was experienced by all animals. This is the very first time when the obstacles become unstable. In contrast with the random protocol where the uncertainty in the state of the world is expected, in this case the collapse of the obstacles is completely unexpected and could trigger an entirely different response from the animals.

A detailed analysis of the responses to the first collapse of the steps revealed an impressive difference in the strategies deployed by the two groups of animals. Upon the first encounter with the manipulated steps, we observed three types of behavioural responses from the animals: investigation, in which the animals immediately stop their progression and orient towards, whisk and physically manipulate the altered obstacle; compensation, in which the animals rapidly adjust their behaviour to negotiate the unexpected obstacle; and halting, in which the ongoing motor program ceases and the animals' behaviour simply comes to a sudden stop for several seconds. Remarkably, these responses depended dramatically on the presence or absence of motor cortex. All animals with significant motor cortical lesions, upon their first encounter with the novel environmental obstacle, halted for several seconds, whereas animals with an intact motor cortex, or with vestigial lesions, were able to rapidly react with either an investigatory or compensatory response.
